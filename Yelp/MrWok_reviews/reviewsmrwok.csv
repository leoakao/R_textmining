This is hands down the best chinese restaurant I have ever been to. I've been a regular here for several years. Jack the owner is one of the nicest guys I've ever met. General chicken is incredible! Everything on the menu is mouthwateringand will not disappoint.
"This is very good and authentic peking duck.... everything else not so much. This is a very Americanized place, but very yummy My love the beggar's chicken, but the wife, not so much. Also the eggplant in the garlic sauce is awesome. Probably the best I've had in DFW.Make sure you make a reservation, because this place is always full"
"We were looking for somewhere with authentic, tasty duck which wouldn't cost an arm and a leg and we found it here, at Mr. Wok. Having been here a number of times with family and friends for duck, we know the drill that you have to call 1 day in advance to reserve for the duck and 2 days for the beggar chicken.  We arrived after 7:30pm on a Friday night and were pretty much seated straight away. This place had great duck, but the beggar chicken in my opinion is just for fun and not really for taste.  If you have never had Peking duck before, I do believe this restaurant does a great job of providing a great first experience. They serve/slide the duck skin and meat right at your table.  Mr. Wok is known for their juicy duck meat combined with crunchy skin, chopped green onions and sweet hoisin sauce wrapped inside a thin, crepe-like covering (they call it pancake but you can substitute for buns if you prefer that instead).  To have a real Pecking Duck experience then you need to go to this restaurant.  It's also a BYOB restaurant so feel free to bring your own favorite wine and beer to pair with their delicious dishes."
"If you're reading this, and have the ability to drive/walk/run/helicopter over to Mr. Wok restaurant located in Plano, TX: my word of advice is STOP READING AND GO NOW!Sidestory: My go-to for Peking duck was a spot in Northern VA (where I grew up); This was where many celebrities, locals, and politicians swear by. Up until my recent visit to Texas, I had thought that place was as good as duck gets...Boy, was I wrong. Dining at Mr. Wok, was not only hands-down the best peking duck I've ever had, but also one of the BEST dining experiences in my life.I came here with my boyfriend and his parents on a Saturday evening. Reservations are needed I believe if you want a peking duck, so call ahead to make sure. We started off with various appetizer dishes such as eggplant (delicious), spinach, and another vegetable dish. All were fresh and prepared well.When the duck came out, it looked amazing. It tasted very fresh and was cooked and sliced perfectly. One duck easily fed the four of us, so I suggest sharing with a group of 4-5. You can ask for the steamed buns (highly recommended!) to make-your-own duck buns with the hoisin sauce and greens that they provide on the side. Everything about the duck was delicious and the buns were really soft. One other awesome thing is that they don't waste here; you can choose to have your leftover duck and bones to make a soup or stir fry. We had the soup, and it was a really good complement to the whole meal. TLDR; Mr. Wok is one of the best places you'll find for peking duck. Try it out!"
"Finally made the stop to Mr. Wok and I'm regretting that I didn't go sooner. As everyone said, you must reserve the duck or Beggar's chicken either a day or two days in advance, respectively. We went on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't full or anything but toward the end of our meal, it started filling up. We reserved the duck earlier on the week and didn't have any trouble.In addition to the duck, we ordered dumplings and sesame chicken with fried rice. The dumplings were interesting. The outer skin was thick and I don't think it was steamed all the way because when I took a bite, it was still a flour-y white. It definitely wasn't the best dumpling I've had but I can tell it was made in house and not from a frozen bag. The sesame chicken with fried rice came a little bit after and it was super good! Very flavorful and the pieces of chicken was tender yet crispy even drenched in sauce. The fried rice that came with it was interesting. Not your typical fried rice but it was still tasty with the chicken. Finally the Peking duck came out (I think it took about 20 minutes or so since we sat down). The man who carved it out for us explained to us how it was marinated and he quickly carved the duck skin first then the meat. He placed the skin and meat on another plate and asked if we wanted the leftover duck stir fried or soup as a second course. So be warned that when you order the duck, it is a two course meal! We got the stir fry and it's basically the duck carcass so lots of bone fried in a sauce with mustard cabbage. It came out super fast and was flavorful but difficult to eat because of the bones. The Peking duck itself was delicious! The skin was crispy and the meat was moist. The sauce really helps bring the flavors to the buns so don't go easy on it! You also pick between pancakes or buns at the beginning. We picked the buns, obviously! Definitely worth the trip here at least once. The people were super nice and the experience was one that you don't to have much."
"If you like Peking duck, I would advise checking out Mr. Wok!  Probably one of the best places in Dallas for this. Be sure to call ahead and reserve it a day in advance. The restaurant itself is small and tends to get packed so call ahead to make reservations to avoid a long wait. They bring the duck out and carve it table-side for you. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender and delicious. It also comes with steamed buns or pancakes, green onions, and hoisin sauce. For the second course, they give you the option to use the bones in a soup or stir fry which they will prepare and bring out to you. (5/5)This place is BYOB which is also a plus. I've always left happy and satisfied! Highly recommend!"
"Very delicious. The duck is roasted then fried. Very crispy skin. But after frying, it is a little bit too oily. If it is just roasted in oven could be perfect. Very good portion. One duck can make three different dishes: Beijing duck, duck bone soup, and stir fry duck bone. Only 35 dollars in total. Very good price for a delicious meal! And good service. Customer can even bring their own wine!! Recommend!"
"Well, they know me by name, so you can draw your own conclusions about my regular stops there. Mighty busy on Friday and Saturday nights but they still manage to whip out a To Go order for me. Amongst my favorite dishes are: Eggplant with chicken or pork, Spicy Green Beans with same. Need to try their Peking Duck and Beggars Chicken."
"I was asked by my new coworkers what I wanted for lunch today. I said Chinese. Chinese was a very good choice..The General Tso's lunch was cheap, fast, and came with a hearty beef egg roll. Probably the best tasting chicken I've had in a long time. It was hot, juicy, fried to perfection, and the sauce was amazing! I might have to pick up some carry out before I head home after work, while I'm still training in this Plano area.."
"Mr. Wok is a cozy little unsuspecting Chinese restaurant in East Plano that is often praised for having the best Peking duck in the DFW. You have to order it 24 hours in advance. Another signature dish, the famous Beggar's chicken, requires a 48 hour notice. The Peking duck was just okay (for lack of a better word). I expected super moist, super tender, super juicy...and it was none of those things. What it was was very average. I do appreciate the fact that they don't waste the remainder of your duck and use it to make a second course. We opted for the stir-fry VS the soup. Not a bad flavor to the stir-fry but there was hardly any meat seeing as most of it went into our buns so maybe the soup would have been a better option. I also felt we didn't get enough buns but oh well. The Beggar's chicken is definitely cool in terms of presentation. It's one of those dishes that you order once just to say you tried it - not something I would get again. It's a fun dish to get with a group so that someone can hammer on the bread that encases the dish before your server actually cuts it open for you revealing a whole chicken wrapped in leaves. I am slightly confused seeing as the menu said it was a whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice amongst many other things mixed into it. When the bread was cut open, I only saw chicken. We mixed it around some and couldn't find any sticky rice. The overall flavor was a little underwhelming. Pretty unmemorable. Overall, I found Mr. Wok to be overhyped. The dish that everyone raves about is nothing spectacular. While this wasn't my first time having Peking duck, I wouldn't proclaim myself as a Peking duck connoisseur. The service was great though."
"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with the family.Pros:Surprisingly decent prices.  I was expecting higher but was pleasantly surprised.Good portions - plates were fairly big and we definitely had enough foodTaste was on point.  I felt like most everything was what it should be or better except one dish the twice cooked pork could have been better.  The pork had bones and was super dry.The steamed rice was well cooked, and I'm glad it was free.Cons:  The service was a little lackluster.  The waiter could have been a little nicer and showed some more initiative.Overall I would come back.  Food tasted pretty good and good portions."
"This place probably has the best Peking Duck in Dallas.  It is two courses. The first course is the traditional skin and meat with the steam buns, hoisin and scallions. The second course can either be the duck soup or stir fried duck bones. Must reserve this a day in advance.  I assure you that you will not be disappointed.  They also have the traditional Chinese dishes, which are great depending on what you like, but again, do not come here unless you order the duck."
"Always a good meal here, although it can get cramped.  Therefore, always try to make reservations for dinner or even lunch.  And if you want Peking duck during the weekdays, you have to call ahead and reserve the duck because they make only so many. Peking duck here is a must and I would say it's one of the best in town as it's not greasy and really crispy.  You can select between a pancake or bun. We prefer to eat our  Peking duck with the buns. Then you can select between a crispy stir fry or soup for the remaining duck meat and bones.  Go with the stir fry as it's a very flavorful and satisfying dish. A few of my other preferred dishes are the sautéed green beans, mango shrimp and poached tilapia work bok choy. Service here is top notched.  As busy as they get, they always try to be fast and not show that they are not being overbearing."
This is a very standardized Chinese restaurant. nothing fancy here. The portions are reasonable and the food is really delicious. I am not sure why its always empty i think the location is not the best. Its very clean and like i said earlier the food is really what you'd expect from your typical chines restaurant.
"BYOB :) Delicious and flavorful food. Love getting the family style options with bigger groups, but today  I noticed the lunch prices on the back of the menu and omg I need to come back sometime soon and get an individual entree. I have loved everything I've ever tried there so far and I will def be back soon."
"Wanted fried rice for dinner tonight. Open Yelp app and went off recommendations. BingoFirst time here at Mr Wok. Parking lot was full and over flow next door. The place was packed and people waiting. The place smelled awesome, all that wonderful food coming out of the kitchen. The price was very reasonable for fried rice, l will be returning, they have alot of items that will fit my diet.ConsNo utensils ln my to go order. l will let that slide."
THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN !!!  Ingredients are fresh... sauces are not saturated with MSG...  Jack the owner is really friendly and treats everybody like family.  Great service.  My family and I have eaten there at least once a week for the past several years.   All the dishes are delicious and very reasonably priced considering there's a lot of care that goes into preparing them.  Highly recommend it.
"First time here on Saturday and it definitely won't be the last! The duck here was delicious! Crunchy skin and succulent, tender meat...it was so mouth-watering good! My group ordered ordered two ducks and for the duck bones, we got them to do both the stir fry and the soup. The soup was great but the stir fry was even better! The nice thing about this place is that if you don't want to order duck, they have a regular menu as well that offers plenty options. Oh, and it's BYOB, so bring a bottle of wine, eat some duck, and have a good time!!! :)"
"Oh man. Every other time I go to DFW I go here and get a Peking Duck and stuff my face with it. There really are no other words of the joy that my mouth feels. It's like the happiest Chewbaca, but like MORE. You know how sometimes when you have a secret it's like even more precious and joyful. It's like a secret joy. It's contained inside. Okay, stop this nonsense Sarang. Anyways, point being, it's great. Food is fresh, it's not a huge place, it's one big room with booths around the edge and tables in the center, probably not much more than 25 tables, but it stays pretty full. If you want the Peking Duck, call ahead and they'll be sure to reserve one for you. Next time, I'm gonna need to go with 4 people because I want to try the Beggar's Chicken but not at the cost of not having the Peking Duck. MMMDELICIOUS."
I was very disappointed. After all the reviews i had really built this place up to be let so far down.We ate tonight Wednesday about 5pm only 1 other customer when we arrived.All the items we ordered had so much filler vegetables or fruit very little meat (see pics) I got the signature dish Mango shrimp there were 5 shrimp and about 2 full mangos so much mango made the dish entirely cold.  Daughter got the Mongolian beef not spicy at all and i would say about 1/4 cup meat rest was vegetables then hubby got the curry beef with a complete full onion and what tasted like dried peas not fully hydrated. The fried rice was not fried at all it was older rice chewy mixed with soy sauce nothing else.  Nobody came to check on us for drinks or how we were doing at anytime. Very disappointed and will not give a second chance was not worth it.
"Before our Chinese born roommate left America for a life abroad, he wanted to show us what Peking Duck tasted like. True, he was inspired to show us this because of an episode of Hannibal, but we appreciated the gesture anyways. If you're going here for the duck, make sure that you call in ahead of time. And one duck is best to be split between 3 to 4 people. Trust me, those little things end producing a shitload of meat, spread across 3 courses of preparations of them. I seriously wish that I could remember the names of each concoction throughout the meal, but the taco-like part was my favorite, followed by the soup. And, as the large group of Chinese business men sat down at the table next to us, we learned two important things about Mr. Wok. (1) It's BYOB. This group of 10 businessmen probably had 3 cases of beer with them, so shit was 'bout to get rowdy. (2) The local Chinese clientele in the Plano/Richardson area approve of the food and how it's presented at Mr. Wok. That is priceless when deciding where to eat.All in all, this place was so fantastic that I'm having cravings right now, and I rarely eat meat. If you're looking for Peking duck, this is where to go in the Plano/Richardson area. Everything is expertly prepared, cooked, and presented."
Really juicy and delicious Peking duck! Skin was crispy and at the same time it melted in my mouth.  If you order the Peking duck they will either stir fry or make a soup with the left over.  Mapo tofu was also excellent.
"Mr. Wok is hands down my number one place to go for Peking duck. With table side carving of the duck, it's a guarantee you'll get that crispy skin you came for in the first place! If duck is not your thing, there are plenty of other dishes that won't disappoint. Try the ""Crispy Tangy Beef"", another dish I get all the time.This place is small so be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations. It seems like it was a Pizza Hut at one point that have been renovated into a Chinese restaurant. Parking is also small but they allow parking at a nearby lot just down the street."
"I was soooo excited for this!! I heard about this place from 2 different people- they also advised that we needed to set a reservation on a duck at least 8 hours ahead.I set a reservation a day beforehand with a pleasant woman and we arrived at 745PM and were sat about 5-10 mins after. It seemed very busy and hectic but our server was super nice and friendly!We didn't get anything besides the duck as it was a 2 course entree and there were only 2 of us. Good thing too, we couldn't finish everything!The owner came out with the duck and started carving quickly while the aroma filled a bubble around us. omgsh it smelled SOOO good!! After he finished, he asked us how we wanted our second course- stir fry or bones soup. We asked for both so we got half portions of each!We also opted for the buns (between buns and crepes). The buns were so fluffy and white! I was a little disappointed because the buns were pretty cold by the time the duck was set on our table-carved and ready.They brought out the buns super early too. It would have been AMAZING if the buns were hot. But that's my only takeaway on the first course.The duck skin was so crispy and fatty and delicious!! The meat was so juicy and I enjoyed every single bite!! The stir fry was with some bitter/pickled cabbage which I'm not the biggest fan of. I didn't like this too much except that the duck skin was even crispier which was so much more amazing!I liked the soup more because the taste of the cabbage was a bit more muted and not as overwhelming. Bottom line: The peking duck here is absolutely amazing. The service is fast and friendly. And between 2 people- 20$ for a very very filling delicious dinner? Worth."
Mr. Wok never dissappoints. Get the seared edaname and pork dumplings for starters. Peking duck is a must for first timers...followed with the soup. Green beans are excellent too. I liked combo fried rice as well and makes good leftovers. BYOB!!!
"I would rate this more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars overallll. Came here for my sister's boyfriend's birthday and I really enjoyed the low key, family style portion sized Chinese food. The restaurant use to be an old Pizza Hut which I was able to visualize after being told so. Parking spots are very limited and confusing so just keep your eyes opened due to the confined space. We ordered sooo many dishes and I love the fact that it's byob (poppp as many bottles without feeling guilty...lol). My favorite out of the 6 dishes (wish I knew the correct names) was the Peking duck, vegetable noodle soup, and this sautéed green onion with beef. Now I'm sure you've noticed how popular the Peking duck entree is according to the past reviews so make sure you preorder the duck at least 48 hours before dining at the establishment. I really liked the buns and crepes intended to consume with the duck. I feel as if the Peking duck was somewhat on the bland side. I wasn't very impressed with duck ... maybe I set the bar too high? I really enjoyed the authentic step up from ramen vegetable noodle soup dish which is large enough to share between 4 ppl (as an appetizer of course)!Overall: I thought this place was mediocre. I'll probably return but most likely won't. I was pretty disappointed after my first time dining at Mr. Wok. Hopefully, it'll all change after my next visit."
"Could've easily been a five, but the ridiculous wait knocks it down a star. We had a reservation at 7:30, and didn't get seated until 8:30...why offer reservations then?! That perplexes me til this day. But the manager was very apologetic and offered us a free appetizer because of the wait. I was still a little annoyed by the wait, but the food made me forget all about it. We got 2 of the Peking Ducks, and it was out of this world! They do a tableside carving, so you get a meal and show all in one. They serve you the meat and skin with steamed buns and tortillas. Then they make you either a soup or stir fry from the leftover bones. Talking about getting your money's worth. We got one of each, and I prefer the soup over the stir fry. It was just refreshing after all that meat and carbs! The stir fry wasn't all too bad though. It was just a lot of heavy eating. Safe to say I was in a food coma afterwards. The duck was moist, the skin SUPER crispy, and the service impeccable (except for the wait, but it was a busy night so I'll let it go). This place is an hour from us, yes an hour. So probably won't be coming back in the near future. But definitely will have to go back to try out their Beggar's Chicken. You have to call in advance to place the order though since they don't make extras!"
"This is a really unique place.  You can get good Chinese food in a lot of places, but none of the other ones I have ever been to can do a DUCK like these guys.If you call ahead, you can order a Peking Duck that will knock your socks off.  Not only do they serve it in a really cool way, they will make fried rice, soup, and other things with it after the table presentation.It looks like an old pizza hut from the outside (it was one) but don't let that fool you.  They are always busy and the food and service are why.  It's also very reasonable for a great place.Jack is the GM and he's super friendly and professional.  Don't miss this place."
"This place has great reviews on yelp so I had to try it out. If you want to get a seat, especially during the weekends, you have to call for reservations ahead of time. Sometimes even a day in advance.We were seated right away. The restaurant itself is small. The building kind of looks like an old Pizza Hut, but they decorated it pretty nicely in there.They have a full menu but what great is that the menu tells you which dishes are their Signature Dishes. I would recommend ordering any of their signature dishes. My crew ordered the Peking Duck, the Sesame Chicken and the Banana-Chocolate Spring Rolls. There are certain dishes you have to reserve a day or two in advance such as the Peking Duck and the Beggar's Chicken. My crew loved the Peking Duck. They cut it into small pieces in front of you. You eat it with pork buns, a sauce and vegetables. They take the remaining pieces and make it into a smaller dish with vegetables and a soup. I personally didn't eat any of the duck because I don't like duck. However, if it counts at all, my crew ate all of their dishes to the bone. I ate the sesame chicken. The dish was ok. I really should've ordered something with more flavors but it sounded good on the menu and it was a signature dish. Not too many different flavors with the sesame chicken. The dessert was pretty good. Super crunchy and sweet. Plenty of banana and chocolate in each bite. It comes with a caramel dip. All in all this place is pretty good. Everyone in the room seemed to be in awe of the two signature dishes...Peking duck and Beggars chicken. It was pretty cool how they presented these two dishes. As for the other dishes on the menu, I wasn't as pleased. I can only say for the sesame chicken but I wish it had more flavor. The dessert was bomb though. I would definitely recommend eating here!"
"Wow!! From the outside and inside you can see Mr. Wok doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. This is a hidden gem tucked aside for those adventurous to search for. Do yourself a favor and end your search for amazing food here. Grab a group of friends, reserve a table, and reserve a Peking duck!Coming all the way from the Oak Lawn area of Dallas to Plano I expected nice food, but I have to say my mind was blown!! Now I used to live in Houston and visit their Chinatown all the time. I know what great food is and this my friends is great food!! Honestly one of the best if not the best Peking duck I've ever had!! We had our duck cut table side by the owner himself, Jack. The explained how the ducks are marinated the night before and cooked fresh when you order it. Jack shared with me a secret that makes the duck skin extra crispy and the mean lean which I'll just say I'd have to agree that it works. The skin is crisper than others and the meat lean.The remaining duck meat on the bones was then used to be stir-fried into an equally nice dish. Lots of flavor with one of the several ingredients Jack shared being garlic. We also had the Mr Wok sampler of appetizers which was tasty, but thinking back I wish I had more belly room saved for the Peking duck.There was plenty of parking and seating when we came but it quickly changed and was packed with a line and little parking by the time we left. I'd recommend having a reservation or coming early. Long story short: great service, legit food, and cool experience."
Best Chinese food hands down in Plano Texas. Get the duck and try the second portion stir fried. The dumplings are the bomb.
Made reservation way advance for my moms birthday. Very busy  hole in the wall. The place is very crowed to get around. Not handicap friendly. It was difficult to guide my dad around in the wheelchair. I felt bad to ask people to move for us. We finally set down and it took and hour and half to get our pecking duck. We order some appetizers and it took 30 mins to get it. We also order other side dishes and they missed two dishes and we told  them to cancel it. We can't wait any longer. The service was horrible. The poor kid was running around frantically. There was two server and one person to cut the duck. Way under staff. The owner seems she doesn't care at all and stay at the front and not help the tables. The waiter just ignore our table and didn't greet us and just ask rudely are you ready to order. The food was fantastic but the service was down hill. Will not come back until they figure out their wait staff.
"I came for lunch and the service and prices are awesome! Lunch meal is $5.75 - $5.95 for egg roll or egg drop soup, entree and rice. I subbed fried rice for white rice. I had the Szechwan beef. Sauce was great with a lot of veggies. Unfortunately, not much beef which I understand for the price. It was a HUGE portion so I had the leftovers for dinner. I chose the egg drop soup instead of the egg roll. It was a different broth and consistency than what I'm used to but thought it was very good. It also included some veggies which was a great surprise. Also had an order of crab rangoon that was eh. Not terrible but not fantastic. My coworker had the pad thai which he did not care for but this is not a Thai restaurant. Stick with the Chinese dishes. I will return for lunch and try new dishes. For the price, how could you not?!"
"I saw great reviews on Yelp and was so excited to try the Peking duck. However, after trying the duck, I felt deceived and duped because it was terrible. The meat was dry and extremely bland. They cut off about 50% meat off the whole duck in front of you to eat with the buns, then they took the remaining to the back to make you a ""second course"", which really is just the chopped up remains and stirred fried. See the picture here -- it looks as bad as it tasted. I was served white rice with the duck but the rice was old, cold, and hard. On top of the bad food, the place was filthy. I looked up the ceiling and there were dusts formed all over the place. It looked like they haven't cleaned in decades. We sat by the window and the blinds were just as filthy. If the front of the restaurant is like this, I can't imagine how dirty it would be in the back. All in all, this is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. It was a waste of money! $35 for a dried up duck.9/9/2016 - this is in response to Jack's (business owner/manager/duck carver) comment to my review. Hi Jack, Thanks for your response but your assumption is incorrect. I'm used to flavorful & tender duck meat even after the fat has been rendered. Yours tasted like you didn't only strip the fat but also everything else with it. All I tasted was a doughy bun with hoisin sauce filled with rubbery duck meat. I understand that you might not like negative feedback but please don't proceed to imply what I'm used to in order to undermine my review. Every Yelper has the right to express their opinion and let the reader decide for themselves whether to try your restaurant."
"Waste of money!!!!Came here tonight because my wife was at The hospital down the road and this was her last meal since she couldn't eat anything past midnight and ordered King Pao Chicken. We got the dinner daily special since we didn't want a ton of food and that was a mistake. Size wise, it's a lot of food. However what is actually put in the meal is a joke. Tons and I mean tons of bamboo shoots, (I actually filled my second opening in the togo box full of them and still had some) lots of peanuts, peas, and minced thigh chicken meat. I threw my food away after I gave up trying to take a bite of food without bamboo shoots. Never coming back. So sad too as I am only 15 minutes away normally."
"We made a reservation and arrived well before our reservation time. We still had to wait 20 mins after our reservation time to be seated. What's the point in making a reservation?Decor: 3.5/5-Looks like it use to be a Pizza Hut inside? -The red booth seats look comfy however we sat at the round table which can comfortably seat 6 without obstructing traffic. The round tables can seat up to 10, maybe more. Service: 4/5Food: 4/5-The begger's chicken was unique and came in a huge loaf of bread. The chicken was moist and tender yet nothing to brag about. This was about $37.-Peking duck was roughly $25 each and more worth it than the beggar's chicken-Calamari app is a must however it is slightly on the salty side-Singaporean rice noodles were standard, nothing to brag about-Combination Fried Rice was great. Wish I had gotten two orders of that. Will be returning for the sizzling shrimp and scallop dish"
"Food - 3Service - 4Value - 3I feel like the last couple of times I've come here that the food just isn't as good as it used to be and the prices feel like they keep going up too.  The Peking duck seemed dry the last two times and the Beggar's Chicken also seemed a tad try the last two times as well.  Because this place is so popular, it can also get quite crowded on the weekend for dinner and then you end up with some fairly cramped quarters from time to time."
"Great and affordable place to come for some Peking duck - just remember to call ahead to order the duck. The duck is juicy with nice crispy skin,.  We get the stir fry duck bones, which are a pain to eat but tasty and you can't go wrong with the pancakes.  However some of the sides are a little weak.  Th sauteed egg plant came swimming in sauce which we didn't appreciate.  Next time I want to try the begger's chicken but you need to order a couple of days in advance."
"We had 2 roasted duck, mango shrimp, and Beijing beef. Each of the ducks leftover bones were used as a stir fry dish & duck soup. The duck was really flavorful but I wish the duck skin was crispier. The mango shrimp was weird, it all just tasted like seafood (that nasty seafood taste) & the shrimp was soft in batter. As for the Beijing beef, it was really good!! I liked the duck soup because it was really hearty with all the herbs but the duck stir fry just made the duck kinda dry. Overall the duck is really good & fresh! The server was really friendly."
"We made reservation around 4pm on Saturday and was ecstatic they can accommodate us with a 7:30 reservation. The restaurant is not very big and the decor is dated but it gives you a warm family feel. I did a lot of yelping and asking around so I knew exactly what we were going to get. We went with the Peking Duck with the stir fry, Crispy Red Snapper, Combination Fried Rice, Parmesan Prawn, and Water Spinach with Beef. The Peking Duck was exceptional, everyone at the table loved it. The guy who cut our duck was welcoming and talkative which made the whole experience even better. The only critique I would have is that the water spinach and beef was a little salty and had an overwhelming taste of oyster sauce. However, everything else was great. I would definitely recommend Mr.Wok to my friends and family.  Important: You must make reservation if you don't want to wait or get turned away and do not skip out on the Peking Duck!!!!"
"This place is amazing. I like the Peking duck, the chicken, and the sweet and sour fish. They do need reservation and advance notice for the duck/special chicken."
"Primarily came for the Peking duck! You must call in and order in advance. The Peking duck comes with the buns, veggies, and hoisin sauce. You can always order more buns if needed too. There's also a choice of roti/pancake instead of buns. The meat is really tender and fresh. The skin is perfectly crispy. There's a person that serves you the duck and slices the meats for your at your table. At the end of your dinner you get a choice between two different soups. The one we had was really light. It was a good balance with all the food we had.Orange chicken and crispy tango beef are my other two favorite meat side dishes. If you're a fan of the mayo mango shrimp, I wouldn't suggest getting it here. It's not my favorite. There's a lot of mango versus shrimp. It's BYOB as well!I went with about 8 people. We got two Peking duck orders and 9 different plates. Splitting it evenly between everyone it was about $23 give or take. It's well worth it! You definitely leave the restaurant with a food coma."
"Once again had an incredible meal there!!!  The sizzling seafood skillet is fantastic. All3 of us enjoyed our entrees. Also, out server Allison was the best ever. Friendly, cheerful and playful. She made sure to not put our entrees in to be cooked until 5 or 10 minutes after our appetizers arrived. A rare thing. Highly recommended to be sure!!!"
"Best Peking Duck in Dallas, hands down.Everything I've tried here is good but honestly, the Peking Duck just steals the show.  They bring out the roasted duck whole and slice it up table-side.  I think it may have been the owner who brought out our duck and he was so nice, taking the time to explain how they're able to get the skin so incredibly crispy while keeping the meat tender and juicy.  The dish comes with either pancakes or steamed buns (my preference).  Grab one of those piping hot buns and layer in some amazing duck meat, crispy skin, hoisin sauce, and scallions, and you've got the most amazing bite ever. Bonus!  They'll take the bones and leftover meat and make you a second (very large) duck dish-- either a stir fry or soup.  Can't beat that!"
"Absolutely ridiculous!! We just got our order dropped off. Waited a few hours, ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Almond Chicken, wontons, and chicken chow mein. dishes....and some have NO CHICKEN! To top it off we got TWO chicken less Kung Pao dishes, and not our Almond Chicken!! They literally are full of disgusting water chestnuts and peanuts! Not one piece of chicken! Only the chow mein had chicken and the wontons are the only thing not messed up... We're beyond livid with this and cannot believe someone thought this was acceptable to send out. We ordered through a delivery service, and the place is now closed so there's nothing we can do at this time. I really urge someone to be held accountable for this cause I have never in my life ran into something this bad. We don't even understand how this place has so many stars?!?"
"Sometimes they're on and others...I've experienced the best fried rice and will go back a month or so later and the rice is hard, they're out of eggs, or the ribs are hard and tough as heck! Not sure what the inconsistency is about but..."
"If you are ever in the mood for pei king duck, this is the place you need to go, and FYI you need to order the duck in advance before you go.I went to dinner here with 3 friends and we got 1 duck and 3 side dishes which was more then enough food. We ordered water spinach, salt and pepper shrimp, and tofu family style with pork. With the duck the server cuts it right in front of you and it comes with buns and sauce to wrap the duck with. The duck bones and remaining meat can either be used for a soup or stir fry- we chose stir fry. The duck was so delicious, it's very hard to get duck so juicy and flavorful but this place did it, I was so impressed with the duck. Everything else their was subpar, but the duck is a must! The stir fry duck was a little salty and everything else was over cooked. The tofu with pork was good, but again on the saltier side. Everything comes with rice though! The service here is so unstaffed. They were so busy even on a Thursday night that it took a long time to get anything we asked for, even our check."

Mango shrimp surprisingly goodRed snapper fried excellentRed snapper steamed excellentPot stickers just ok Bok choy shitake mushroom very goodGreen beans fried with tofu very good Shrimp fried rice very goodService here always goodFried donuts with banana fillings good
"The other reviews and late dinner with some close friends led to high expectations.One thing that's kinda cool is this place is an old converted Pizza Hut - you know the actual restaurant where going as a kid to get pizza with the family was an experience. Anyway, rose-tinted memories of mediocre pizza are now replaced with quite excellent Chinese food with the always appreciated BYOB option.I got the wonton soup as a starter which had great broth and good wontons. Not a bad start. For my main course I went with the Szechwan Chicken. It was pretty tasty but I'll be honest I was a bit disappointed as I expected more. I couldn't tell if they used real Szechwan Peppercorn which is supposed to numb your tongue a bit - first time trying it. There was too much sauce where I prefer a drier style.Still, my business dinner companions enjoyed their meal and they live close by so this is still a great option in Eastern Plano / North Dallas."
"Oh man, one of our new favorites --- for the entire family. It's certainly an eating experience ordering the peking duck. It's as authentic as you can get here in the states. It feels like a hole-in-the-wall place when you drive up and even when you're inside, but that's what makes the atmosphere so great. Mr. Wok has been recognized time and time again in Dallas, and there's many reasons behind that. Every dish we've had has been amazing - full of flavor and delicious. Keep in mind that the restaurant is small - reservations are preferred with a large enough party, parking is limited, and it's a converted Pizza Hut building or something like that. If you know this information and visit for the atmosphere, food, and service, and not judge by appearance, it's a 5-star dining experience"
Best Peking duck in the DFW and much cheaper. The restaurant is always packed so call in advance.
"Pleasant spot, nice staff not expensiveDuck at dinner may be the treat  described belowbut lunch was sugary gloppy '60's american/cantonesethat I can better from the freezer at Kroger's"
"This place is amazing I'm new in town and found this place, the food is fantastic juicy freshly cooked and the service was great. I'm for sure coming here everyday!"
"I've lived in Dallas for a little over 10 years and always chose Thai or Vietnamese over Chinese since my Chinese restaurant experiences had been ho-hum at best. Until today. This place is small (in a former Pizza Hut) with 12 tables. Had the appetizer sampler which found us saying Wow, oooo, try this one. Got the Crispy Tangy Beef with fried rice and it was the Japanese shorter grain rice with a good chew and flavor. Beef was tender, green beans were fresh and crisp. We saw 2 tables get the beautiful Peking duck and a table get the Beggar's Chicken. The carver/waiter offered the mallet to one of the diners who whacked the bread dome over and over with no success. I clapped and cheered him on and the rest of the diners joined in - success! We will be back. Loved it!"
"This was our first time at Mr. Wok and it was a great dining experience.  We ordered the Peking duck and it was fantastic!  With table side carving, the duck was tender, had very little fat, and the skin was so crispy.  Our waitress was very nice and recommended we use the bones for stir fry and soup.  I loved the stir fry, the mustard green was crunchy and always one of my favorite ingredients in any dish.  The soup needed some flavoring, if you add a little salt, it's great and a nice ending to any meal.  Service was excellent."
"There are two places in DFW I would order peking duck from: Mr. Wok and Beijing Brothers in Coppell. Mr. Wok has been around longer, but I did not try their duck until recently. Their meat was not gamey when freshly carved and served. However, the stir fry (made with leftover meat) did taste gamey... but it could just be me, as I am very sensitive. I recommend calling ahead to pre-order, since they are known for this dish and sell out quickly. I also tried their whole fried fish, and loved it. It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce poured over the fish was sweet and tangy. Overall, this is a good place for a casual family dinner. It looks pretty run-down, so it's not the most ideal place for a date or a girls' night out. Prices are a little higher than other Chinese restaurants but still reasonable, considering most of their dishes are shareable. Service can be hit or miss, depending on how busy they are."
"Went here based on the reviews.  I've been several times and all visits have been great to good to fair - seemingly in that order - so I don't know if I should go back!  Crab rangoons are big!  The last time I ordered lunch to go, the rice was crunchy, which kind of ruined my sesame chicken.  I will probably give them another chance, but it may be a while."
"Hands down one of the top 3 Chinese places I have been to.  Please you must try Mr Wok if you haven't before.First off, the fact that traditional Chinese families (think 3-4 generations all together) come here for dinners validate this place is legit.  Top that off with a team of servers who have been here (and know the menu well) a while, you can trust their recommendations.  Also VERY affordable!! Food - cha Han fried rice is legit. The duck is a MUST get. Crispy beef is also very good. The egg foo young, basil noodles, sesame chicken, orange chicken, mango shrimp are all....good but not great. Can't wait to try the other dishes.Parking can be tough, this is BYOB so keeps your bill down! Heard ""meh"" reviews with Beggar Chicken.Please if you're considering this place, do your taste buds a favor and just come!"
"Modern take on classic Chinese dishes,Mr. Wok does not disappoint. FromThe Beijing Duck that is carved and served in a wonton to a crispy beef that melts in your mouth, this quaint location needs a reservation on weekends. They have several speciality dishes and we try a different one each time we go. If the wait is too long, order take out. It travels well."
"The peking duck experience here was awesome. They carve the duck at your table and will explain on how they made the duck. On top of that, the duck was tasty which just completes the experience. I would totally recommend on taking a date here especially if they never had peking duck before. But be sure to call ahead of time to make sure they have ducks though since they're made in a limited quantity."
"Love this place and eat there ever so often. The Peking duck is wonderful and some of our party has had it in Beijing. The food has always been often but last night our waiter sucked. We got appetizer plates and for 3 adults he brought out 2 dinner plates. WTF was I supposed to use? The little ap plate evidently. He never came back to refill water. We had to flag him down after 10 mins looking for him. We have never had him before. Hope we never have him again. We have had the beautiful red headed woman and another man and always been pleased but this guy was terribleThe guy was a tall, med brown haired white guy about mid 20 s, with glasses"
"I'm from CA and when I'm in town visiting family I have to order thePeking duck.  I can eat the buns that come with the order alone it's fluffy, airy, semi sweetened.  The duck skin is crispy and holds a lot of flavor."
"This place is great. You should order the duck a day early to assure you get one.  It is byob but that just makes it really inexpensive.  The duck comes with pancakes (like tortillas), scallions, and plum sauce.  The extra bones are made into either a stir fry or soup.  We've gotten the stir fry both times.  We had lots of leftovers both times.  The service is great and they are really nice.  The only reason for a missing star is because the table covers are stained and it makes it seem dirty, but it was not.  Some cloth table covers would really dress up the place instead of the hard plastic stained ones.  We will definitely be back again for the best duck ever!"
"Get the duck! It needs to be ordered in advance just like the Beggar's Chicken. I went with a group of friends and we ordered ahead for both which would have been plenty for all six of us but we decided to also try the Orange Peel Beef, Chicken Chow Fun, and Bok Choy. Everything was amazing but the duck was probably my favorite. They bring out the whole duck and the server cuts it up and serves the meat and crispy skin on a platter along with wraps, veggies and hoisin sauce for part 1. For part 2, they use the rest of the duck and prepare it either in a soup or stir fry based on your preference. We did the stir fry and it was delicious - lots of garlic. The chicken dish is quite a show and the meat comes out very moist since they roast it for 22 hours within the bread, banana and lotus leaves, and aluminum foil. Friendly service too! We'll definitely go back."
"Small restaurant on 14th street. They're well known for their Peking duck, which I was hoping to try.Unfortunately, since this was a spur of the moment thing, I didn't pre-order one and was just hoping to get one of their extra ones they sell first-come-first-serve.Well, unfortunately not....Fortunately their other food turns out to be pretty good as well.We tried their Cantonese crispy noodles, puffed shrimp, mango shrimp and pot stickers.The Cantonese crispy noodles are not like the birds nest noodles at most Chinese restaurants, but almost as thick as spaghetti and, for a lack of a better word, a fluffy crispy. Very interesting and also very tasty. It came with a dark sauce, veggies and your choice of a protein. The sauce was pretty mild (I usually prefer spicier fare), but still tasted good.The pot stickers were delicious, filled with cabbage and pork, with a nice bite.The puffed shrimp was shrimp bis in a puffed up dough, also very good.The mango shrimp comes in a bowl made with wonton dough and filled with cold mange, a sweet sauce and crispy fried shrimp on top. Not bad, but a little sweet for my taste.Overall a very good meal and I'll definitely come back, and this this time I'll call-ahead for a duck. Oh, and it's a pretty small place, so you may wait a little to be seated during rush times."
"Friendly staff but the food was awful! I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce, which came out as a clumpy mess. The steamed rice was overcooked. The pork egg roll was cold on the inside so it was probably just reheated. I had high hopes based on previous reviews but I won't be back."
Attentive service.All of the quality of food was exceptional as was the presentation. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal. This place is consistent and we will return again soon.Adjacent table ordered several Peking ducks. They were carved at the table and the experience looked incredible.
"Jack,Don't get me wrong, your place do have good peking duck and have been there a few times.I call at 1 pm but all your server say was no table that fits 15 people and never said anything about tables were being reserve nor anything else then hung up. That's what made me upset, which if you were in my shoes would be too. Also the person who call back was my bro, so that can get an answer from another person."
One of my all time favorite places for the last 13 years! We love Jack the owner also! Do yourself a favor and eat here!
The peking duck was fantastic! One duck is enough to serve 4 people .  You can serve the rest of the duck two ways. I prefer stir fry instead of soup. Other things were pretty good too.  I testify that they serve authentic Chinese food!Be sure to make a reservation on weeknights. You'll need to reserve a duck when make the reservation. Just try everything!
"This was a very nice experience.  A busy place.  Food was great.  Portions are large enough to share.  There were 2 of us.  Had an appetizer and one meal and still had leftovers.  They do have a lazy Susan in the middle of 4 large table to serve family style.  Those table seat 10 comfortably.  Nice staff.  There specialty is Duck.  This is something you have to call and make sure they have, if not you can order it.  Large groups are best to make reservations.  Will definitely go again."
"Still going strong and still the best Peking duck in Texas. Service was great. Erick was our waiter and he was on the ball throughout the night. The owner Jack made recommendation for dishes in addition to the duck, which is the way to go if you are a large group."
Peking Duck was amazing. Crispy skin.  Great flavor. Mango shrimp was just okay. Not enough shrimp. Too sweet for my palate. Will definitely return.
"Since we took it to go, this review is solely on the food and the taste. Effing delicious. Crispy skin, juicy meat. No need to explain. Reserve yours now and try it!"
Yum yum and yum.  I've been here twice now.  Reservations definitely required.  Food is amazing.  Everything was scrumptious.
This place was highly recommended for their Orange Chicken. When we were seated we noticed how greasy dirty the fans were and tablecloth was stained. We ordered Mongolian Beef and received a plate of mainly sliced onions and beef pieces so small you couldn't pick it up with a fork. Not much heat or flavor either. The Orange Chicken was tough and tasted like it had been cooked some time before we ordered it and sauce added and reheated. We should have sent it back but the less than $20 tab wasn't worth it. Will probably not return.
"When we drove up to this place, we saw a tiny lil building with a parking lot full of cars. Who would've thought that such amazing food would be here?? We ordered the peking duck, beggars chicken and fried red snapper. The duck needs to be ordered 1 day in advance, while the chicken needs to be ordered 2 days in advance so keep that in mind if you plan on coming here. The first thing we got was the duck, which came whole as the carver delicately slices off thin layers of the crispy skin and the tender meat underneath. We had our duck with the steamed buns, hoisin sauce and green onions. The skin was so flavorful and crispy. The meat was soft and meaty. Totally delicious. This has got to be one of the best peking ducks I've ever had ! After carving the duck, he asked if we wanted it stir fried or cooked in a soup. We selected the stir fry option and we were so happy with our choice. The duck came out crispy and sooo flavorful! It was stir fried with onions and these pickled veggies. It was amazing! Next came the beggar's chicken, which was served in this giant hard bread and the waiter asked if anyone wants to try to crack it open. Inside it was a foil wrapped whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice. The upper portion of the chicken was quite bland and dry but as you dig deeper, you'll find the juices that give it a good bit of flavor. The flavor was  a bit too herby for us so we weren't too crazy about this dish, it was cool for the experience though.Lastly, we had the fried red snapper. Wow, this dish was beautiful! It was a huge, meaty fish that had this meat sauce poured over it. Can't quite describe the sauce but it was yummy! The fish was crispy and flavorful and surprisingly, this was only $25 for an extra large! (although I'm not sure if we're just really hungry but the XL wasn't that big as we ate the whole thing between 4 people)Overall, we had a wonderful experience coming here. The food was great and I would recommend the duck & the snapper to anybody. I wouldn't go back for the chicken but it is a good filler if you are trying to feed more people."
"I've been here twice and each time I was disappointed. The food is mediocre at best.Peking duck w/buns: The duck is dry and bland. The buns were stuck together and would rip apart. The hoisin sauce is hoisin sauce, always good. As you are being served the duck you are told that it is a high quality lean duck. All I'm saying is I don't care if it is an organic, fair trade, humane certified full beaked pond roaming lean duck that gets daily massages - if you dry it out you've ruined it. Lean ducks should still be juicy and rich when made properly.Broccoli beef: I didn't enjoy it and don't recommend it."
"Not bad but not the greatest Chinese food I had. This place is tiny so expect a wait if you want to eat in. If not, you're better off getting take out. Service here isn't very attentive but it's doable. I see they're trying their best. The food has been inconsistent between the two times we visited. On our first visit, food was great. But this second time, most of of food came out cold or not up to par like our first time. Shrimp fried rice came out cold and the crispy beef had too much sauce. The first time we ordered the fried snapper and that was great. But if you don't want to pick at the bones the thai sole is delicious and comes without bones. Haven't had the chance to try the peking duck but it looks great. I'll probably be back again but I'm still on the lookout for a more authentic Chinese place."
"This is the second time I've been here and it just gets better!  The restaurant is pretty small and they have a small staff so there is normally a bit of waiting involved.  That kind of thing rarely bothers me so I don't think it's a big deal but I know some people might get annoyed.  I came in a party of 6 and we all shared the appetizers of dumplings (delicious, fresh, and hot) and lettuce wraps.  We also got the Peking Duck and Beggar's Chicken (both of which you need to reserve 24 hours in advance due to the way they cook it).  The Peking duck is carved table side and the skin is crispy, the meat is juicy and it is absolutely amazing.  It comes with very thin pancakes/tortillas to wrap the duck in with hoisin sauce and onions.  Then you get the choice of what you would like them to do with the rest of the meat still on the bone (stir fry or soup).  We've gotten the stir fry both times and it is amazing in its own!  Just the duck can feed two people.  The Beggar's Chicken comes encased in a bread bowl that they crack open at your table (they'll even let you do it if you want to)!  The chicken inside is wrapped in foil and bamboo leaves so it will cook and seal in all the juices with the sticky rice.  The chicken is SO tender you scoop it out with a spoon!  Overall it is by far 5 stars!  I can't wait to come again, maybe during lunch since their lunch prices look really good!"
"Mr. Wok, I would like to personally thank you for letting me make a fool of myself in front of the entire restaurant while I was trying to crack open the bread for the beggars chicken we ordered. I then watched you with your fancy shears cut open the bread to reveal a beautiful bird wrapped in leaves. The chicken was ridiculously tender and the sticky rice filling was amazing. The chicken was huge and we ended up taking it to go and it was 2 containers worth (not filled all the way). My dad (Chinese food connoisseur) was pleased with the way it tasted, the last time he had it was in China and he hasn't been able to find a place that served it. We also ordered the Peking duck which was delicious, I personally like getting the buns over the pancakes. The pancakes are fine but I don't like how hard they are to peel apart and its just one big lump of pancake. For our second duck course we got the soup this time which was really great considering we ate soo much food, it was light and flavorful. It had some noodles and some cabbage added to the broth. The stir fry is a little more filling and messy but there is more flavor. We also ordered some eggplant in garlic sauce and man that was really good, it wasn't what I was expecting. I was thinking it'll be some garlic on eggplant but it was a deep and dark flavorful garlicky sauce, it is totally worth trying. We also ordered fried calamari and pot stickers. The pot stickers were the typical frozen to pan, nothing special; not worth ordering. The calamari was fried perfectly and had an intense but not too strong garlic flavor. We came here on a Wednesday night and every table was taken (thankfully we had a reservation). Ducks were flying out of the kitchen every 10 minutes, I think I saw at least 15 ducks being served while I was there, this place is obviously known for their peking ducks. The service was fine and it was an overall great experience, I highly recommend this restaurant!"
I wish this place was much closer to me in Ft Worth !  The Peking duck is unbelievable and you get a second course with the duck whether it's stir fry or soup. I've been here twice and literally everybody gets a duck!  Definitely call in advance to make sure you have a duck that day! I would recommend giving a call 24 hours in advance!
"I love this place, they make the best Peking duck I've had in Texas. They bring it table-side and carve it right next to your table. The skin is crispy. The meat is juicy and tender. It's exactly how a duck should be made. They also make a second dish out of the bones, either a stir fry or a soup. The stir fry option is a bit too heavy for me after eating all of the duck meat from the first dish so I prefer the soup option.The only other thing I've had here is their corn and crap soup which is also really delicious.They are very popular so expect a wait if you come during peak hours. If you know you want duck, be sure to reserve one ahead of time since they sometimes run out if you come late."
Best Peking duck in town. Small cozy place. Our favorite is the Peking duck with buns but make sure to make your reservation a day in advance or no duck for you. Also they only serve it on weekends. Another great dish is beggar's chicken.
"I tried this Resturant base on all the good reviews on Yelp. They must have paid Yelp to filter all the bad reviews. 4 stars?... Are  you kidding, I was very disappointed in the food. We ordered the Peking duck and it was terrible, the skin had a thick layer of fat on it, the ideal Peking duck is not suppose to have fat on the skin, it suppose to be roast and bake until all fat are melted and leave a crunchy skin. The schuwan beef is a joke, the beef was chop up so small like it was ground beef with over 75% of onion, a good thing I love onions. I had to give the credit on the chow fun, it was decent, but still not good. If this Resturant was in china town the wouldn't last more than a month. Nothing special, I will never come back."
Best Peking duck in Dallas! Service is awesome.. However this place does get packed.. I would suggest calling previous to going to see wait times...
"I haven't found any other place with good peking duck in Dallas yet, and the duck is always pretty good here.  Be sure to pre-order it at least a day or two in advance, since it takes some time to prepare.  All of the other dishes I've tried here have been authentic and tasty, as well.  Come with a group if you'd like to eat family-style and try more dishes.  I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu items!"
My star rating is all about the food and service.  This is a very casual joint in Plano that by the looks of things must be housed in an old pizza Hut. Packed in a random week night we were glad we made reservations.  If you want the Peking duck (and why wouldn't you! ?) Pre order this 24 hours in advance. .. the beggers chicken is 48 hours I think. We went for the duck and having had peking duck before at a top Beijing restaurant I wasn't expecting to be wowed.  But wowed I was.  They carve the little quacker table side and the pieces of duck skin with a thin layer of fat just melt in your mouth. They use most parts of the duck so you get to choose a fried rice duck dish with some parts or a soup with the bones. .. or you can ask for some of each. Everything was delicious. Some of the side dishes are well worth ordering too.  The eggplant dish was just phenomenal. If you want Peking duck I haven't found anywhere better in dfw (please message me if you have an alternative! )This is legit!
Love this place. Great service.  Duck carved at the table is fabulous. Roasted perfectly.All sides are good. Price is right.Limited parking however.Try it!  BYOB
"I was really looking to this place after reading other yelper's reviews. I ordered the pot stickers as an app, and they were worse than the Mr. Panda ones I get at Costco. Too soggy, without that ever-so-slight crisp I really enjoy. The sauce was not quite sweet enough for my liking either. I ordered the Szechuan (sp?) chicken for the main course, and was once again let down. Very little chicken to vegetable ratio, and they use white meat, which tends to be too dry in many Asian dishes (IMHO). The service was good, and the BYOB aspect is always cool. I'm keeping it at two stars, because the price was reasonable, and maybe I didn't find ""the right dish"". A couple next to me ordered the roasted duck (carved tableside, I might add), and it looked delicious. I'd be willing to check it out again, but not after I try the 50,000 other restaurants in the greater DFW area."
"Very small restaurant. Nice servers.  We came at 7:30. Got seat in 15mins.  Got the LAST duck (2 styles)! Yay!!! And it was only by chance because someone canceled their order.   Great crispy lean duck!! Yes! We picks the buns and it came out with enough Hoisin sauce and shredded green onions for the table! The only thing I can complain about the duck is it wasn't marinated in anything.  So without the hoisin sauce, there was no other flavor.  Our second style was sautéed, which did come out very flavorful! We heard the soup is kind of bland.  Sesame chicken... It was okay.  Lighter sweet flavor, a little different than what you are used to.  The chicken is very thin cut and a lot of breading to it. I don't think we would get this again. Whole tilapia - we didn't try it because the sauce it was doused in did not look appetizing.  Halfway to a very thick soup consistency. Our group was not impressed with it though saying the fish did not taste fresh and overcooked.   I would come back for the duck and the beggars chicken at another table looked very interesting."
"This place is wonderful. My father and I frequent here often. Food is always delicious and the staff is very attentive. Down side is, being the location is rather small, in the evening the wait time can be long and the place becomes rather noisy.Food: Amazing. A++Atmosphere: Decent. Can become noisy when crowded.Service: Wonderful.I will definitely continue eating here and highly recommend others to try it out."
"Peking Duck is superb - great service on a busy, busy Saturday night - we love our regular dishes: mango shrimp and water spinach - yum - depending on the friends we bring along, we order more dishes with their tastes in mind - it's also BYOB here - love Mr. Wok!!!"
"The Peking Duck is carved in front of you, which is interesting. You would think these presentations will only be offered in higher class restaurants. As for the taste itself, it was pretty good, but I still prefer Peking Duck at MyCanh. What I like most about the Peking duck here is that they offer you a choice - if you want to wrap your protein in the bun (which is what I prefer) or the mushu wrap (much like a tortilla wrap). I'll probably come back once in a while, but I'll head to MyCanh for the periodic Peking duck cravings."
"Fantastic food and great service every time! We love this place! Plus, BYOB doesn't hurt!"
"Oh, Mr. Wok.  Oh, how I love you!  It had been quite some time before I had ventured back to reestablish this relationship.  It was Chinese New Year celebration week and on 2/21, I'd organized a group of friends to come try it.  It was the continuation of a beautiful friendship.I had done my duty, ordering the Peking duck 24 hours in advance.  I alerted my friends to the BYOB charm of the place.  We arrived at noon, our table having been reserved by Jack himself!  It was so crowded too and I was happy that my friends who arrived early were able to be seated.  The place is small and crowded due to the festivities.  We were able to savor our drinks, ordered appetizers to keep us busy and then enjoyed watching the two, huge beggar's chicken being rolled out to be smashed in by the guests who ordered them!  That looked fun.  A giant dish, with a puffy crust of bread was punched into by the mallets they give you with the meal.  Inside, a chicken that is stuffed with sticky rice and mushrooms, wrapped in foil to make it extra juicy and tender.  Oh, that is definitely on my list for next time!We ordered the wok seared edamame, which has a great flavor.  The crispy tofu that everyone tried- so fluffy and delicious paired with peanut sauce.  Vegetable fried rice that came with bean sprouts, vegetable chow fun noodles and a couple of appetizer samples- which had some fried stuff.  The steamed dumplings were delicious.  That kept us occupied until the duck arrived with Jack set to carve it like a master!  Oh, snap.  I am pretty sure I gave a brief set of instructions to the new acolytes!  First the bun, then hoisin, then duck, duck skin & scallions.  Roll that up and eat!  The carcass still had meat on it and we ordered that stir fried.  As the plate of duck was placed in the middle of the table, everyone dug in.  It became a race to see which of my duck loving friends could keep pace with me.  As everyone slowed down and I started in on my 4th roll up, I could tell my party was fat and happy!  We walked away with leftover Peking duck stir fry, fried rice and noodles.  For my party of 8, the tab came out to $17.xx and for the culinary feast we enjoyed, that is well worth it.  Somehow, I ended up with the leftovers in my fridge.  No worries, friends, they're all gone now- and yes, I shared with a couple of other friends!  All of it was so good and such a rare treat!  Until next time, Mr. Wok, I'll be dreaming of that delicious, buttery duck skin- and planning my next attack!"
"Food (***** out of *****); This is the best Peking Duck in Dallas. Unless you want to fly to China, you will not find a better Peking Duck. The skin is crispy, the fat underneath is soft and warm, and the meat is juicy. Yum! The duck could be seasoned with herbs and salted just a tad more, but that's just a minor nit pick. Their other dishes are good to ok, but the duck is stellar! I normally just order the duck. It's a big bird so if you're just 2 people dining, there's enough food in the duck dish to feed 2 people for several meals (take some home). The duck comes with Chinese tortillas or bread buns, green onions, sauce, and after you're done, they can use the bones to stir fry it or cook a soup with them. Their fried fish is good. Everything else is just ok. Ambience (** out of *****); Restroom is not very clean, but to be fair, it not disgusting, either. They really should put some of those blue disinfecting balls in the bowl and have some air fresheners in there. The restaurant is very tiny. However, you cannot fault someone's restaurant for being tiny, because it costs MONEY to pay rent. What most reviewers don't know is that on weeknights when business is slow, they still have to pay rent.Service (**** out of *****); Good service. The waiters had good teamwork. You can ask any of the waiters for assistance and nobody will turn you down because, ""it's not my table."" (I just hate that)Conclusion; Although the tally is 4 stars, I gave them an extra star due to superior value. The restaurant is BYOB so you're free to bring your own alcoholic drinks. I love Peking Duck with Tsingtao beer. Ain't nothin' better. It's a great deal. For $35 (not including tax and tips), you get enough food to feed two peeps for 2 to 3 meals. Yay!"
"Went here twice in two consecutive days. The first night, after coming on my friends request (she said she was craving peanut butter chicken. I shrugged it off as a white person thing), we arrived at 8, and their business was booming. We had to wait at the front for 10 awkward minutes before one of the 2 waiters even looked at us. They had an extensive menu, and my first thought was, how can they possibly cook so many things well?! They don't. I ordered the Sizzling Seafood Platter, which was absolutely disgusting. But my friends PB Chicken was to die for.  Second visit was with my bf. The crab porridge appetizer was tasty! We ordered the pecking duck, which is a 5 star over and over again. It honestly reminds me of the Beijing duck I eat back in my home country. The skilled waiters carve he duck in front of you! (If you order their bread chicken, they put on yet another good show!) The skin is so crispy, don't hesitate to add it in your wrap; the put it on the side, but it's not just garnish! For the second course that comes with this order, we had the stirfry option and it was very flavorful (duck soup isn't good). They didn't waste part of this animal, just like we do it in China! The patrons all seems very happy. But what I suggest for first timers, just order their most popular specials to be safe."
"Fantastic!! Three Peking Ducks, plenty of appetizers, and great laughs with friends. With the duck leftovers we did two bones and a soup! Both were amazing! Mr. Wok, where the lazy Susan turns into the roulette of death when you over order!"
"Great food and great service!! Though it's very busy, our server, Allison, took great care of us. We ordered the salt n pepper calamari, potstickers, Bok choy n shiitake mushroom, and the famous Peking duck (remember to preorder this or else they won't have one for you). The bill come up to about $60, so cheap!! It was a pleasant surprise lol. All four of us were very full. This restaurant is small and intimate. Definitely recommend to reserve before going because it's small and they get packed pretty quick. They don't care about food presentation at all (hence its not really picture worthy). However, the flavoring really made up for it (isn't that what food is really about anyway?). The dishes were presented in their simplest form. As for the main dish (which is the Peking duck) is one of the best I've ever tasted. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. They carve it right in front of you. Will definitely be back again.Merry Christmas everyone!"
"My family and I have been coming here for ten years and the food is consistently good every time. The Szechuan beef is excellent and the dish has tons of flavor without being too oily/greasy. Yummy food at a great price, they do get very busy so consider getting your food to go if you're in a hurry. Love this place"
Absolutely amazing food. We have the Peking duck in the Beggars chicken and it was outstanding. I'd recommend this place to anybody and we've eaten everywhere.
"I'm going to visit Mr Wok again this Friday for Birthday party.  This place is a GEM.  Best Authentic Peking Duck plate ever and it tastes heavenly.  Reservation is mandatory for ordering Peking duck because they roast it over night.  Place is pretty small so it gets really crowded fast.  I think after 7 pm during weekend, good luck finding a table if you don't make reservation.  Peking duck is about $35 and most people trying to get a table, order this to make sure they have a reserved seating.a master carver demonstrates carving a whole peking duck infront of you, that was a treat!  tastes so good!BYOB so you can bring your six packs or a wine if you preferhope you enjoy like we did and we will again"
"I really enjoyed our sit down experience. Normally I do pick up, but my husband wanted to go with me. Upon walking in, he commented how cozy it felt. We decided to eat there. Immediately were seated and had great service the whole time thanks to Allison! This place is BYOB. Awesome! Will remember for next time. The food was delicious. Mr. Wok came to check on us and it felt welcoming! We recommend this place for sure!"
Make the reservation a day ahead for the Peking duck. Amazing table presentation of the duck. Get the steamed buns to enjoy that crispy duck skin!!Not sure what the soup after presentation is like but the stir-fry with the duck bones and remaining meat was so flavorful. The pot stickers are so good that I could have eaten a plate full. So full and no regrets!
"I love Mr. Wok's Peking Duck. The skin is crispy and melts in your mouth. The meat part is tender and juicy - all without ducky smell, while keeping the flavor within. I had the duck to-go several times because of this, and have enjoyed them at home and friends' places. With that said, the service we had on the last time we visited (dine-in) was unpleasant. We had a reservation for 7:30 to serve my mentor's family and his mother who was visiting. The party arrived at 7:10 - with 4 kids all under age of 6 - as the weather was bad and we did not want to risk of being late. (If arrived late more than 15 minutes, then the restaurant reserves right to give up the table.)  We let them know we have arrived, who acknowledged  the reservation for 7:30. The people who were sitting at the table where we were assigned to were finished eating and already had their leftovers to-go, but they were sitting there until 7:32 - which was fine. Even after the table was cleaned, we were not able to sit for another 15 minutes. After we sat down, our appetizer did not come out for another 15 minutes. For 7:30 reservation, our meal started 35 minutes late. As I arrived, I asked if the meal could be ready at 7:30, as the kids are hungry, which they replied ""yes"". But that was not kept. Another thing was carving. I read so much of how nice to see duck carvings on the table side. As I had the ducks to-go before, I was really excited for this experience. Our first duck was carved behind us, which practically no one was able to watch without bending or twisting. I showed the lady a nice spot with no traffic and plenty of space, on the table, but she refused. She came to the empty spot for the second duck, thankfully, the party was able to see the carving and take pictures. The ducks were luke-warm, and soon turned cold. Asking for straws, fork, and/or napkins? Good luck, b/c it took us multiple requests and a long wait to get them on the table. I was really embarrased to treat my mentor and his family at this restaurant with the long wait, multiple requests on utensils, and luke-warm food. I still tip them plenty for the food, but not sure if I would visit the place again with the service I have experienced."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Dallas/Fort Worth! I highly recommend ordering their Salt & Pepper Calamari and their Peking Duck! It is best to call in and make a reservation for the Peking Duck to ensure availability, since it is a hot commodity. Their Peking Duck, complete with either buns or pancakes of your choosing, is absolutely amazing. I especially love it since it is very reminiscent of my childhood. They bring it out to you freshly cooked and slice up the juicy and tender meat right in front of you! The service is also impeccable here. The entire staff and owners are friendly, sweet and highly accommodating! If you haven't tried Mr. Wok, you are really missing out!"
First time to eat here. It's very good Chinese food try the orange chicken it's very tasty
"This place has some of the best Chinese food I have been coming her for 18 yrs the owner jack knows my whole family, they are byob and make u feel like family love this place"
I love Mr. Wok! I just come here for takeout for lunch or dinner but ever ytime I get something I am always satisfied and glad I came.  Their lunch menu is inexpensive and extensive.  They have traditional Chinese food that has all the great flavor and authenticity of a real Chinese kitchen---no mall food court bland food here.  I recommend the Mongolian beef or any of the shrimp dishes.  So glad this place is close to work!
"Truly amazing Peking duck and crispy fried whole snapper. The Peking duck is huge and juicy. Also, the chef pumps air between the skin and meat of the duck before roasting it, thus allowing the skin to get super crispy and lean. Most of the fat simply drips off while the duck is being sliced at your table side. Our server recommended the whole snapper with black bean sauce. I haven't had fried whole fish this amazing since my trip to Hong Kong.  Presentation of the duck and snapper are excellent. Really impressive authentic Chinese food (except the fried rice which was not good)"
"They are known for their Peking Duck and Beggars Chicken which is a chicken makes inside a giant bread ball.  The bread ball is too hard to eat and is just for show b/c you have to crack it with a mini hammer. Peking duck usually needs to be ordered a day in advance but you may be lucky and be able To order same day since they make extras sometimes. Duck is the best thing: crispy and fresh and they carve it at your table. Small, hole in the wall place. U can eat the duck with steamed buns or the crepe like pancakes but I love both! ""Other items on the menu like twiced cook pork and mapo tofu are standard and decent. Banana chocolate eggrolls are a nice sweet treat for dessert. I'd go back for more duck and crepes. Beggars chicken is good but more for show. Good for groups but it's a small place so reserve!"
Read the reviews and stopped by. Sat down and were asked for drinks. We asked if they have mineral or sparkling water (our preference) = doesn't have any. Asked for bottled water = doesn't have any. Asked if their water was filtered. Waitress went back to ask and said no just tap water. We got up and left but not before telling them that they should have more options than sodas. They apologized which was decent. Sad in my opinion since I would have loved to try their food.
"Mr. Wok is a Chinese restaurant in Plano that is known for an excellent Peking Duck dish they serve.  It's also located in a renovated Pizza Hut.  You'll find some other good dishes here but if you're going to only make one visit, order the Peking Duck.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - It's in a renovated Pizza Hut.  I know I said it already but there are implications.  First, it's a popular/busy spot so parking is limited.  Also, they try to squeeze in as many tables as possible that the result is there's very little room between tables/chairs.  On really busy nights there may be wait so make reservations and call in your Peking Duck order.   1/2 Star.Service - Our server was awesome.  I could tell that not only was he used to working with large groups but with tight spaces.  As dishes started coming out for our party of 10, he was able to expertly move, combine, and find spots to keep food going on the lazy Susan.  Add the fact the drinks remained full the whole time in the chaotic atmosphere leads to one finely skilled server.  1 Star.Food - This the third time I'm mentioning the Peking Duck.  They bring it to your table, cut/carve it up, and then serve it up with steamed buns or pancakes.  I preferred the thin pancakes but it's nice to have an option.  What's great is that there's no bone, it's hot & fresh, and is the best Peking Duck I've had in DFW.  Definitely the best dish they have....and the most memorable.  The rest of the dishes were forgettable, including the mango shrimp that I couldn't decide if I should have eaten it hot or cold.  Bottom line is that while the one dish they made was the best I had in DFW, I can't recall anything else I really liked.  But best in DFW does carry a lot of weight.  1 Star.Will I Return? - When they move to a bigger place.  I feel Mr. Wok needs to be moved to a new, bigger space.  The old Pizza Hut is actually cool, but it's not claustrophobic friendly.  The Peking Duck is outstanding and is a no brainer to order.  I guess even if they stay put I'll still be a huge fan of this signature dish.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
"Customer service here deserves a 3. Called in ahead to make a reservation and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes. I had to order my food ahead for the group so that when the seat us, the food would be ready. Once we were seated, we got all our food right away. The peking duck came in a little later. I gave this restuarant a 4 just because of the duck. One of the best ive had because it wasnt greasy or fatty at all. Very lean and it came with the pancakes and bao. Overall, good chinese food for DFW."
"Another great Peking duck experience at Mr. Wok. Well worth the long drive and 45-minute wait for the freshly roasted bird with the crispiest of skins.Bonus: 2nd course with the bones is included, either soup or stir-fried with pickled cabbage. Yum!Pro Tip: Remember to bring your favorite adult beverage as it is BYOB with no corkage fee... The Tom Thumb store at the corner of 14th and Jupiter has a very nice selection of chilled wines and beers.Don't forget to tell Jack and Allison that the Deep Ellum Duo sent you! :)"
"Cheater! The 10% off discount from Dealmoon is just for Beijing duck not all, but the coupon indicates that it is for all dishes, and the food taste like crap!"
"Very small place, I don't think they deliver everything I try a new place I get the fried rice first the reason why? Because it's very hard to mess up that dish and I don't want to waste my money on more expensive dishes if they can't even get fried rice right. Well I must report that unfortunately they didnt,get the fried rice right"
Loved owner Jake and waitress Eary.High quality very flavorful food. Tried crispy tangy beef and it was sweet and yummy. Packed
"Best Peking Duck I have had stateside! There are many reviews on the duck so I want to recommend a few hidden gems.While some of these dishes sound super Americanized, I promise they are good.Eggplant in Garlic Sauce(option:+shredded pork): The way they cut their eggplant is very different. It comes in much smaller pieces so the flavour really sink in. Delicious! Mango Shrimp: I wish they have more shrimp in this dish but it has an interesting hot(fried shrimp) vs. cold(mango) silky taste.Stir Fry Bean Sprouts: I think this dish costs less than $5 and it is done very well. A very crispy veggie dish you just cannot put down.This place is tiny (I think no more than 10 tables), thus it is always packed. Definitely call ahead if you want to visit on the weekends."
"Food was just okay. Shrimp fried rice contained very small, undeviened shrimp. I picked up to go. Fly in the area where I was getting food. Didn't seem to be the cleanest place. Waitress came from outside and assisted with bagging food without washing hands. Prices were reasonable is the only positive I had."
"Two words: Peking duck. This is something you should definitely try. Cute little place in Plano. Usually busy on the weekends so make reservation if possible. This is also a great place for family dining. For additional entrees, try their mango shrimp and eggplant. Every option on the menu is quite satisfying especially when it comes with a good price."
The Peking duck and stir fry is amazing! I also would recommend the fried calamari! :) Jack and his team are always very pleasant and we come back for the great food and service!
"Had a surprise birthday party here for my wife. They were very accomadating for the party. They gave a big enough table for thr entire party and small table for cake and alcohol (its BYOB). They appetizers were good especially the sampler platter. The peking duck was by far the best ever, it tasted like butter with the crispy skin and its succulant meat. They take the meat from the meat and make it into a soup or stir fry which is delicious. The customer service at this place was excellent. They were very accomadating and friendly. The owner working in the kitchen was very comforting however he greeted and took time to talk to us. There were pictures of celebrities on the including Troy Aikman. If this place is good enough for him then its good enough for me. I  am definitely coming back here."
"Don't be fooled by the exterior, this former Pizza Inn in an older neighborhood houses a killer Asian restaurant! I was turned on to Mr Wok by a friend several years ago. We are now regulars. I have never had a bad dish there and the Peking Duck is a best ever. Pad Thai is great too. My wife loves the Fried Rice and since she orders it everywhere we go, I guess she'd know!The prices are very reasonable, even cheap for the quality. It's cheerfully BYOB which saves even more since my wife enjoys wine with her dinner.Word is out and this place gets very busy nearly any day of the week. Go early or expect a wait, but they do take reservations if you have 6+ people or order a duck. Duck is supposed to be ordered in advance but I've had good luck walking in and getting one early in the evening, they are so popular they make extras.You do have to understand the service. Not only is it almost always crowded and busy, but food comes out when it's ready rather than trying to serve everyone at the table at the same time. This may be a cultural difference and certainly works if you are sharing dishes at the table and does ensure each dish is fresh and hot, but if you are doing the each to his own order thing someone may get to watch everyone else eat for a while. Better to share and enjoy anyway, it's all going to be good!"
"the peking duck here has to be ordered in advance, but it's totally worth it. nothing like seeing your duck carved at the table right in front of you. my favorite dish here!"
Quick update: the peking duck here is truly an AMAZING and incredibly flavorful experience. You must call ahead of time to reserve yourself a duck but it is a MUST! and its very filling! My husband and I have gone several times now and we always have leftovers to take home!
"I definitely want to take my family here one day. We had the beggars chicken, Peking duck, combination Cantonese stir fry, and chocolate banana egg roll. You have to call 2 days ahead for the chicken and 1 day for the duck. The Cantonese stir fry isn't on the menu but we saw a picture of it on the wall.I've never seen food presented in this manner before. The chicken was stuffed with some rice/herbs and the chicken was baked for 22 hours in some bread. They let you ""beat"" the bread before they cut it open for you at the table. So everybody's in the restaurant will stare at you because of the noise. The duck is actually sliced in front of you where you can choose between either some tortilla or a bao (get the bao). They give you an option to use the remaining bones and meat to either make a stir fry or a soup. I didn't really like the chicken that much bc the duck was soo much better, but it was still delicious. The duck skin was so crispy! It comes with the typical dipping sauce and some green vegetable. The chicken was pretty moist that the meat easily pulled apart when you're digging into it.The stir fry had a tasty sweet sauce topped onto the crispy pan fried noodles. I would recommend the stir fry and Peking duck!The chicken was like $35, duck was $32, and stir fry was less than $8 bucks? The price is really cheap since they give you a large portion. I looked through the rest of the menu and I don't think i saw anything over 10 bucks. They have lunch specials for around 6 bucks!This place is BYOB. The waitress originally gave us the regular American menu but then the owner dropped off the Chinese menu that has more options to choose from."
Had the Sesame Chicken lunch special today!  Unbelievably priced ($6.22!) and I literally ate everything in the plate! Not even shredded lettuce garnish was left behind because of that sauce! The vast demographic of customers this place brings in speaks volumes for how loved this place is by almost everyone who's ever tried it.
Easily the best Chinese food we've had in Dallas. We had Peking duck and orange beef. Outstanding!
"Always a great dining experience. Our server Alma was the best, having properly taken care of us and practically the whole restaurant as well. Full house on a Tuesday night which should tell you how good of a restaurant this is. Buff owner carved our duck and has an awesome personality. Not a single thing to say negative. It was all good and highly recommended. Good job Mr. Wok!"
"I really enjoyed my first visit tonight to Mr. Wok in Plano. I've heard very good things from friends & family and read excellent reviews. My cousin invited me to dinner for a very belated birthday dinner. It was a Friday night and quite busy. Our waiter David had a very large table & it took him awhile to greet us and bring us some water. Once he did we ordered appetizers and our entrees. First we had the edamame which is wonderful and has a nice smokey taste because it's tossed in a wok before it is served. I had a cup of hot & sour soup and the potstickers which were pan fried and delicious. For our entrees I had the sesame beef with fried rice and my cousin had the shrimp pad thai. I tasted it and it was very good, the sauce was very tasty. For dessert we shared the banana & chocolate filled spring rolls with caramel sauce. So delicious - yummy! Loved them :)David was a great waiter, very friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. The owner/chef also stopped by our table. He confirmed what we had earlier asked our waiter - whether they use msg or not. He said NO! I am thrilled as a very well known high end Chinese restaurant in west Plano still uses msg and have refused to make dishes without it for a close friend of mine who cannot consume anything with it, it gives her severe migraines and makes her quite ill. Thankfully we now have an excellent option so that we can all dine together. Highly recommend you try Mr. Wok. It's primarily a Chinese restaurant with some Thai and other Asian dishes. It is not a huge restaurant so go early or make a reservation. They're famous for their Peking duck which must be preordered as well as the Beggar's Chicken.  Hope to try those soon too."
This is by far my favorite place to eat. I try to get here at least once a week...it's not much to look at but they have phenomenal food and great prices. I would have never thought to eat Peking Duck but I tried it and I literally crave it all the time. I have had the 2nd course both stir fried and in the soup and I will say I prefer the soup but it is good either way. I really could ramble on and on about this place but long story short is that they are by far the best Asian restaurant I have ever been to. I would recommend this to everyone from the hardcore fan and the sesame chicken type fan. Have fun and tell Jack and Evelyn I said hello!
"We just finished the best dinner we have had in a long time at Mr. Wok in Plano.  We had a group of seven and an early reservation (4:30 pm) so they gave us center seating with a big lazy Susan in the middle.  We called them yesterday to pre-order the Peking Duck.  We ordered 3 additional dishes in addition to the duck.  We had crispy beef, sesame chicken, Double wok seared, and sizzling seafood.  The Peking Duck carved table side was incredible.  Crispy skin with moist pieces of duck accented with scallions and hoisin sauce with either pancakes or buns (we ordered both).  All the other dishes were great as well, but the duck was the star.  We tried all three desserts; fried ice cream, fried chocolate banana, and fried banana.  All again were excellent.  Met the owner Jack and had a wonderful evening.  Now my new favorite restaurant."
"Located in a former full service Pizza Hut (remember those?), you might not expect excellent Chinese cuisine, but you'd be very mistaken. This place just goes from strength to strength. Whether you come for the Peking Duck (24 hours notice) or the wok seared edamame or the salt & pepper shrimp or the... Well, you get the pic. Everything is quality here. Just go there. You won't be disappointed. Wait! Nevermind. It's hard enough getting in there as it is. Forget I wrote anything ;)"
Peking duck here is very good and more traditional than most places. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was not crowed which I like. Fried rice was good but the fried green beans and tofu was not. It had great flavor but came out to soft for my taste. Can't wait to come back and try the fish.
"Best Chinese Food in DFW area! Great food and service... what more can you ask for? Must try dishes:-Peking duck (DUH) ... Oh yeah and you also have the option to get a soup or stir fry dish out of the leftover duck they don't use for the Peking duck entree! -Mango shrimp-Eggplant in garlic sauce (my personal fave)-Tofu with smoked salmonMake sure you make reservations a few days in advance and pre-order the Peking duck, if you want it. They get super packed for dinner, especially weekends. Enjoy!"
I love this renovated pizza hut.  So cute and quaint.Fantastic food.  Surprisingly inexpensive for good service and food.
"Service is great--everyone is really friendly to deal with!Out of their two major specialties, the Beggar's Chicken and the Peking Duck, my family and I had the Peking Duck. The Peking Duck was good--the duck was definitely fresh and tender, and the skin was really nice and crispy! I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it was definitely great. On the plus side, they take all the extra meat and bones and turn it into stir-fry (and I think there was another choice, but I can't remember what it is...), which was super tasty!However, the other food--eh, I'm not a big fan. Mr. Wok is a very typical Asian-Americanized Chinese restaurant. We ordered Crabmeat Soup, Sweet & Sour Tilapia, Fried Calamari, & Black Bean Chicken. None of it was... bad. But I didn't think the food here was worth it. It was very typically Americanized and very unauthentic for Chinese food (I mean, there were green peas in my soup and my fish, which you don't see in actual Chinese dishes...), and nothing specially tasty. I wouldn't mind coming back again--but for the Peking Duck alone, which was definitely enough to garner four stars (plus good service). And maybe I'll try the Beggar's, because apparently that's super good too. If you're looking for good Chinese, I would stick to their specialties and avoid the rest."
"Busy busy busy even on a Wednesday. Peking duck (2), fried tofu, fried calamari and mango chicken.The wait staff really tried to accomodate everyone. Arrived at 6pm for reservations, within 30 minutes, all tables were busy and wait staff bustling all over. A+ for their hard work and effort.Peking ducks, om nom nom nom. Called earlier in the day for reservations and the 2 ducks. Ducks were served whole and then sliced at table. Make a mini duck burger with steamed buns or a wrap with the steamed pancakes. We had both! Duck was top notch quality. Juicy and super crispy skin. The leftover carcass could be stir fried in a hoisin/soy/green onion mixture so you can knaw what leftover meat was on there OR you can have a soup with bean thread noodles. Both was good!Fried tofu was silk tofu, lightly battered then fried. Tofu was soft and silky. Served with a peanut soy sauce. It's steaming hot so let it cool before eating.Fried calamari had the perfect seasoning and fried texture. Just the right amount of sweet and salty. So Delicious! The only con was maybe the quality of the calamari itself. The calamari, if really tasted, you will notice it's frozen calamari and may have been frozen for a little too long. But this doesn't stop us from ordering it everytime.Mango shrimp was a first for us. Served on lettuce in a fried wonton? bowl. Shrimp was battered and deep fried, then tossed in a mayo type of sauce with fresh sweet mangos. It tasted pretty interesting and good. Flavor not too strong to overpower the mango flavor. Not sure if it's a reorder item though.Byob! If u forget a bottle opener, they'll have one!"
Great food fantastic service I have only come for dinner with the family on a week night so we never have a problem getting seated several of great dishes Mongolian beef and hunan beef are great choices from the dinner specials the come with fried or steamed rice and an egg roll or soup. I believe the place is byob.
"Possibly my favorite Chinese place in DFW along with YAO FUZI.actually the only thing i want/need is the peking duck. ive only gotten duck like 7-10 times in my life and im freakin asian. i dont usually get it because either a) its greasy as hell and b) VERY VERY boney. they take care of both of these because they used compressed air during the roasting process underneath the skin to render out a ton of the fat so your not just eating fat with some meat. also some great guys come over and slice it all up for you so that you dont have to work so hard at it. the service was EXTREMELY friendly and you see why asians are there. thats how you know an asian restaurant was good. decent crowd even on a friday.i plan to try the beggars chicken next time but it requires 2 day call in. GO TO THIS PLACE NOW. IM GETTING TEARY EYED THINKING OF IT.JEANS: OK by far, even with tshirtORDER: at counter"
"Make reservation. Reserve not only seat but also Beggar Chicken, Peking Duct. Bring your own wine. Expect waiting 15,20 minutes, even with reservation. Expect noisy, homey atmosphere.  Expect crowds and parking on bingo area."
"I'm in love. I called the day before to make a reservation and reserve a duck. Post Christmas and pre NYE, the place was packed with big parties. Our reservation was for 7:30, but it took roughly 20 minutes to be seated. I wasn't mad though. It was chaotically busy, and the manager/owner (?) did his best to accommodate us after I inquired how much longer the wait would be. Thank you! Our server was very sweet even though she was busy. Our appetizers came out quickly. The hot and sour soup is delicious and truly sour. The duck was carved table side and we got the fluffy white buns although they do have the flat pancakes too. It was the best duck I've had since a trip to China ten years ago. I didn't know we had such good duck in Texas! It beats any Chinatown duck in San Francisco. I can't wait to come back. I literally think about this duck sometimes and how much I want one again. Random note: you can choose a duck soup or stir fry for the rest of your duck. I opted for half and half and they were both DELICIOUS. For 30 something dollars you get two courses for two people which is four meals. Incredibly worth it. I am genuinely curious as to whether they use your specific duck or just have a bunch of random ducks from everybody else and portion it out without separating your duck from the others. Not that it matters but I am just curious."
"Mr. Wok seems like a very Americanized Chinese place.They menu seems to include Chinese, Japanese & Thai dishes and the staff seemed so American, that I'm not even sure if they speak Chinese.  As a result, the clientele was all American.Bring your own wine.Ordered:-Crispy Tofu-Appetizer Sampler-Pad Thai-Eggplant-Bok Choy & Mushrooms-Peking Duck (Stir fried second)Everything except for the Peking duck was boring & uninteresting.The Peking duck, however, was great.  Carved tableside, skin separated from meat, traditional pancakes instead of steamed buns & the carcass served in a second course.  The meat wasn't greasy, the skin was crispy,  & the carcass was delicious.__________________________Conclusion:(The Beggar's Chicken looked good, but required ordering 2 days in advance)The Peking Duck is fantastic.  The rest is skippable."
"Eating here without eating Peking duck is like going to chic fil a without eating chicken. The beggars chicken is another novel thing that is worth trying at least once.However I lack the same enthusiasm for the rest of the menu. The service is a bit slow at times and the place is packed during peak hours. But I'm not complaining cause I would imagine the cost of food would go up tremendously if they tried to address these problems.Jack is the most mild mannered and friendliest person you'd ever meet for having 18"" arms. Overall this is one of the must try places if you are trying to get authentic chinese food in plano."
"Beijing duck is good! But remember reserve that one or two days ago.Duck with the pancake which is right exactly the same way that we had in Taiwan. However, the sauce is a little bit sour.  In my memory, the sauce should be sweet and salty, but not sour.Fried water Spinach is just exactly good as in Taiwan.Fried egg plants with pork is also great!The fried fish looks amazing but I think it's too greasy for me.  My friends finished that big fish, and they said it was good!"
"Best Chinese food in Plano!!I'm not a big Chinese food person but I landed here last week since I couldn't find a table at a big name Asian restaurant. We were a party of eight. We ordered a lot of dishes including the Peking duck (two courses), fried rice, whole snapper, noodles, beef etc. I ll admit the summer noodles weren't the best but everything else more than exceeded my expectations. Service is awesome and servers are polite too. A must try for Chinese food lovers."
"Food was very good. Like most people have already stated, even with reservation, expect an additional 15 to 30 minutes wait because this place stays packed. Also reserve peking ducks and beggars chicken if this is want you are wanting to try. Also of equal importance is BYOB. Owner is also very friendly which is a plus."
- Great lunch or dinner spot - Better then typical chinese food spots. Higher quality
"I see that one of my friends who I came to Mr. Wok with has already written a stellar review (Victoria W., I'm calling you out), so let me try to top her. My only reliable comparison of Peking Duck is to Houston's choices of amazing Chinese food. The neat thing about this place is you can order the peking duck with the fluffy buns or the tortilla wraps. For Mr. Wok, I prefer the buns. Everything else was delicious and it was also new to me that they shave the duck in front of you. Please refer to Victoria W.'s review should you wish to compare it to actual Chinese food in China... Ok, where was I? Oh yeah, the service was fast and great! We ordered one peking duck and several side dishes. Unfortunately I can't recall how much it came out to be but splitting tons of food five ways was extremely affordable. Perhaps I was too excited about playing Bingo next door afterwards. I apologize. It's a bit stuffy in there but worth it! Make sure to make reservations ahead of time and specify that you're reserving a duck (or two, or three)."
"This place might be our best find yet. It was packed on a Saturday night and we had to wait almost an hour - but it was worth it. We enjoyed the sampler tray to start (the puffed shrimp and crab ragoons were a mazing.)We then shared the combination fried rice, sizzling sea food skillet and chicken with green beans. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked - not greasy or over fried. We also went home with lots of leftovers. We want to go back and try the pecking duck. And everything else."
Best duck in Texas!!All the foods are pretty customizable to fit your likings as wellsuper awesome
"My friends and I were looking for a place to eat Peking duck in Dallas Texas and Mr.Wok is the place! The duck was amazing and it's just like how they offer it in China. They come to your table, shave the duck and you get to choose to eat the carcass in a soup dish or stir fry (choose the soup!) Make sure that you call ahead if you want to try the duck. You need to make reservations 24 hours in advance to reserve a duck, which is also a plus because it gets pretty packed! Another bonus to Mr. Wok is that it is BYOB!Other than that, it is a pretty much Americanized Chinese restaurant. The positive side is that there is good service. The negative is that the other dishes are typical of any other Americanized Chinese restaurant. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back. I want to try the Beggar's Chicken!"
"Small cozy restaurant looks like it might've been an old pizza hut. The place is always packed though. The food keeps you coming back! Get the peking duck (I think you might have to call ahead for it). It's great food and a show in one. The duck is carved in front of your face and is served with the traditional buns or tortilla. I recommend trying the tortilla out, it's definitely better than using the bun!The mango shrimp is also another one of my favorites. YUM!"
"Everything we had was awesome; even the server.  We started with potstickers and stir fried edamame.  So good we ordered more.  Then shrimp pai tai, mango shrimp, tangy crispy beef and crispy sizzling rice soup.  When your picky 8 year old says it's the best place ever, you know it must be good."
"I remembered to order the duck 24 hours in advance and we got there at 5:30 so it wasn't crowded until we were leaving. I hope I don't get thrown out of Yelp for this but I wasn't wild about the duck. Even the thin slices were really chewy. I thought it would be really tender. But the stir fry they make with the bones was amazing - really intense flavor and texture. The owner came by the table (what a sweetheart!) and told us it's made with mustard greens. I've never had anything like it. We had the soup when we got home and it was still steaming hot. The broth had a good duck flavor and the veg was good but the bones were distracting. I'd have strained them out first. It was a big duck. Even with  two big eaters we took home enough for another meal for two. Big duck. The lo mein, veg and beef egg rolls and egg drop soup were good and the stir fry was a spectacular course. The service was great so I'm going four stars but the duck by itself would have only been three."
"Our first dinner in Plano. Wow, this place is really popular! We came in around 8:30pm and its all full. We had to wait for about 30 min for a table, but the Peking duck is well worth the wait! I like Peking duck a lot but I can't eat much because of the fatty and oily skin, however here it's not really fat and grease, I really enjoyed it. One suggestion if I may, the wrap/bread/whatever u call it coming with duck is too big and too thick... Smaller size and thinner texture will further enhance the taste I think."
"I was hesitant to try this place out because I was never a fan of duck, but I was told that I HAD to try Peking duck since I haven't had it..... and ever since I was introduced to this place a few months ago, when someone suggests we eat Peking Duck, I'm automatically down. We always call ahead to reserve a duck or to make sure its still available. They bring the duck to your table and cut it in front of you, so if you get a little quesy seeing stuff like that, you've been warned! After they cut it, they given you the option of having stir fry or soup with the remaining duck/meat, and we always get the stir fry. Everything is perfect and I've never had a bad experience eating Peking Duck here at Mr. Wok. From the Buns to the sauce to the stir fry, everything is just so good! I've tried a few other dishes here but the Peking duck is by far my favorite."
"Came here on a Tuesday night and this cozy place was packed! They managed to squeeze us in.  We tried the peking duck, fried snapper, calamari, eggplant,  green beans,  ma po tofu and edamame, and everything was delicious.  The duck was flavorful and with crispy skin.  They serve the carcass separately air fried and in soup for 2 additional entrees that were also very good.  The highlights of the meal second to the duck were the eggplant and calamari.  This place is also incredibly well priced.  My only regret is not trying more.   I will be back for more delicious Chinese food!"
I have been trying Peking duck in many places. I can say Mr. Wok has the best Peking Ducking in Dallas area.
"Reservation , we were right on time . We were told they were behind 10 minutes. this was no problem.  45 minutes after we watched everyone that walked in get seated before us.  We kept asking if we were going to be seated next that we had a reservation and had pre-ordered a duck, envisioned the poor duck in the back dry and cold, we asked some people in line if they had reservations--no.  All we could figure is that there was some race discrimination going on--what else could it be?  We were well dressed and polite so...We won't be back  and we will tell Everyone at our very large companies not to try Mr. Wok after all, there are s00000 many good restaurants of this type in the area!"
"Love the Peking duck here. Definitely one of the best ones in the area! Since it's a two course Peking duck, get the stir fried for the second part it's amazing. The way they cook it is very flavorful. TIP Make a reservation ahead of time so you don't have to wait and to reserve your duck as well.I also recommended the fired red snapper - it was delicious."
This is a two in one type of Chinese restaurant. It's so rare to find an Asian restaurant that specialize in both traditional and Americanized dishes. They have stuff like Peking duck for family style sharing on one hand and dishes like sesame chicken on the other. Great lunch specials and daily specials. Can't say anything bad about Mr.Wok...the only thing left to add is that they also have good service.
"Mr. Wok is a small cozy restaurant that was pretty crowded for dinner.  Good thing we had reservations since our party was pretty big (11 people and 2 high  chairs).  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  Sitting elbow-to-elbow added to the family-style experience.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, ensuring our drinks were always refilled throughout dinner and accommodating our requests.The food was excellent!  The starters we tried included the wok-seared edamame (unique flavor and texture for edamame), salt and pepper calamari, cool lettuce wraps, and the crispy tofu (very crispy texure).  Entrees included: mango shrimp (least favorite dish of the menu due to the heavy rich sauce and sseroggy battered shrimp), fried green beans, beef with scallions, whole steamed fish (flavorful and moist), yaki soba noodles, Beggar's chicken, and Peking duck.  The duck was crispy and juicy.  The duck was cut table side and we were left to assemble the pancake wraps with fresh scallions and hoisin sauce. The server even let my 6 year old nephew try to break open the bread surrounding the Beggar's chicken dish, which was very entertaining.The table behind us was celebrating a couple's 50th wedding anniversary with family.  This place is great for family reunions and celebrations, and for sharing an intimate, delicious meal with loved ones."
"This is an updated review, following a thorough response from the business owner.  I'm just going to say that this place is not my favorite.  ""Your mileage may vary."""
"Great food. Great people. Make sure you have reservations! And BYOB. You definitely don't come here for the ambience, and the restaurant is a little small, but if you're looking for awesome authentic Asian cuisine, you must come here. I recommend the Peking duck, but make sure you let them know when you book your reservation or they may not have one for you."
"All I can say is that it's worth a trip to Plano to visit this place.  It is not the best Chinese food ever, but for the price, it is absolutely phenomenal.  Mr. Wok is located in an old Pizza Hut location, and brings all of the goodness of that low overhead to it's prices.  Because of the small size though, the wait can be a little long at peak times.  Consistently rated in the ""top restaurants in Dallas"" lists, it's really a hidden gem.  They have an incredibly wide selection on their menu -- on the last trip, I had the hot and sour soup (great), an egg roll, and the twice cooked pork (also really good!).  Other folks at the table had crunchy beef (yum), spicy shrimp, and spicy basil noodles.  They were all pleased, and lots of sharing occurred.  The best part: we fed a table of six, with lots of appetizers, for $85.  This is the genius of Mr. Wok -- great food and outstanding value.  Awesome!"
"I first came here 2 years ago to try their ramen. I wasn't a fan. A couple of days ago, my friend suggested we eat here for their peking duck. We called the day before to make a reservation for a table and the duck. It came with both traditional buns and thin ""pancakes,"" which were essentially tortillas that you could get at the store. They carve the duck right at your table side and ask if you would like a stir-fry or soup made with the bones. We picked stir-fry - it was good but I wished they just carved all of it instead of making it into a stir-fry. The actual peking duck was delicious though. The skin was very crispy! It's not the best I've had but I was definitely satisfied. On the other hand, my table ordered 4 more dishes and they weren't that good. Portions were also small."
"If you have a hankering for Peking duck, Mr Wok is the place to be. I have to say, Mr. Wok's duck does live up to the lean all natural grade name. At Mr Wok, you will NOT find fat in between the skin and meat of the duck. You will be able to chew on the crispy duck skin without the gelatinous fat. *YUMS* My only issue with the whole Peking duck course is that the steam buns were not the best i've had. It did not seem fluffy, fresh and spongy. The skin wrap on the other hand was a much bigger disappointment. Definitely go for the steam buns here if you have to pick the lesser of two evils. Overall, a great place to have Peking duck at an AFFORDABLE price. I will be back to try the beggar's chicken. Just wished the steam buns were perfected a little more!"
"Without a doubt, the only place I will go to for Peking Duck. Mr. Wok is a tiny restaurant with very limited parking and an average Chinese menu but their Peking Duck is literally perfection. The duck is so delicious that you have to reserve your duck a day prior at least to ensure you'll have one. I love how they bring the duck to your table and cut it in front of you and that they take the bones to make a soup or stir fry. The duck wrapped within the buns they provide is so good and it's nice that they offer additional buns at no cost. It is definitely the leanest duck I've had but at the same time, not dry. We also got the eggplant with pork which was good. The Mango Shrimp is tasty but very small portion for the price. The Sampler Starter is something fun to order and allows you to try quite a few things but out of the six appetizers on the sampler, I probably only found one or two to my liking. I highly recommend this restaurant for the Peking Duck."
"So it turns out that my current roomie grew up next door to the owner of this fine establishment.  She told me that they are the best Chinese restaurant in the DFW area.  I was rather skeptical since I'm such a snob so of course I needed to try it out myself.  Thankfully I was in town for a work trip and our hotel was a mere 10 minutes away. We arrived rather early [they were still setting up the dining room!], and we had our choice of tables.  We told them that we heard the Peking Duck was amazing but knew we had to order it a day ahead.  Luckily they make a couple extra and we were able to get one since we were the first people to arrive.  Lucky us!We ordered some calamari and Cho Cho for an appetizer.  What a great start to the meal.  If it was an indicator for how excellent the meal was, I knew we were in for a treat.When the duck was ready, the owner stopped by our table to carve it for us and told us the story about why their duck is superior to others.  Woah!  He was right!  The meat was so dang tender and the skin was perfectly crispy.  How'd they do it?!  Magic I tell you!  Absolute sorcery!!!For the second course of the duck we had it as a stir-fry.  That was amazing as well.  So many flavors!This is definitely one yummy quacker!!!Next time I am in town I know I will be coming back here!!!! Thanks Jack!!!  :)"
"Wowzers! This place is so authentic! The beef fried rice isn't loaded with soy or over-fried, it is cooked to perfection! The beef & broccoli is so juicy. The owner greets you upon entering & is so friendly! I have read numerous reviews on their Peking duck, so we asked the owner about the ordering process & he said they will be able to have it ready with a 24hr advance notice, so that will be next on the menu. This place has won so many recognitions! There are pics of Dallas Cowboys & Stars players dining here. And it is 5 mins from my new place so that's a score! Love local!!! I'll update my review after trying the duck...to be continued..."
"Oh Mr. Wok, I love you. You keep me hangin' on. In addition to the Peking duck being the star of the show, this place also makes other great dishes. Definitely get their red snapper and the green beans in garlic sauce. Do make a reservation because that's the only way you will avoid waiting in the cramped foyer eyeing everyone else, enduring a 1 hour wait!"
"PEKING DUCK = BOMB! although it requires an extra step of having to pre-order it, just doooo it. You will be glad that you did! I usually come here with a fairly big group so we end up ordering family style.  A lot of the dishes that i've had don't really stand out to me.  I think a lot of people, like myself come here for the Peking duck.  The beggar's chicken is also something cool on their menu but I think it's just neat in terms of presentation but not sure if it's worth it for the taste.  The chicken soup (small size) is HUMONGOUS and will feed a lot of people despite the the recommended portion size of 8-10.  There's supposed to be a lot of good healthy stuff in the soup but I am just not a fan.  It's super bland to me; perhaps it's because i specifically told them to leave out the msg. I want to praise their staff!  They are very friendly and constantly checks up on you! Amazing customer service!  I know asian restaurants have a rep for poor customer service but not here!"
"Mr.Wok has been around since my middle school and high school days and they have THE BEST peking duck. It's always on point and Jack, the owner usually does a cool job carving it in front of you and then they make a delicious soup out of the bones. My other favorite dish there is the mango shrimp! It's so good and different from your typical dishes at Chinese restaurants. Also I never like lettuce wraps at other restaurants but theirs are fresh and full of meat. Definitely try this place out if you like Chinese food! The owners are so friendly and the food is great!"
"Love the food here! Words cannot describe how awesome this place is! This place is tucked away in East Plano, where you often may forget its existence! Gather your friends and family, come out here and enjoy a traditional Chinese dinner together. They're always busy, even at 9pm! It's crazy. You may have to call ahead to reserve your Peking Duck. That's a dish that often is ""sold out!"""
"We went based primarily on the great Yelp reviews.  All in all, it was a great experience.  It was very busy on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away.  Our server was new, but he did a great job and knew a lot about the menu.  There were 3 of us.  One had the mango shrimp.  He said the shrimp were really good, but the mango was just a bit green.  I had a spicy beef dish (forgot the name), and it was great - very fresh tasting with green beans.  Our friend had the green bean dish which she said was outstanding.  We also had two appetizers - crispy fried tofu and potstickers.  Definitely.After we finished eating, the manager (or owner) came by and asked how everything was and thanked us for coming.  We had mentioned to the server when ordering that it was our first time there, and he must have shared that with the manager.  Really nice touch. We will definitely go back.  Both the server and manager mentioned the Peking Duck and suggested ordering in advance.  Will definitely be giving that a try. If you want great food and good service, this is a must.  It's not much for ambiance, but quite frankly, it was a non-issue.  I reserve my 5th star for after I've tried the Peking DuckOh...they do take reservations, and based on the Thursday night crowd, I'll definitely make a reservation next time (even though we didn't have to wait to be seated)."
"The Peking duck is so good. It's a 3 course meal with an excellent presentation. Also, have to note the calamari, pan seared edamame, eggplant and whole tilapia in black bean sauce were very good. Make a reservation or plan to wait a good while."
"I never thought I would be writing a review of a place called Mr. Wok that's located in an old Pizza Hut building in suburban Dallas, but here I am.  And while I'm not Asian I have the say the food on multiple visits has been consistently good - and most of the clientele is Asian.  Quite frankly it's a bit of a strange menu of different flavors including edamame, lettuce wraps, egg rolls, Chinese-American dishes, and even Pad Thai.  It seems to be mostly Chinese food for American tastes but there's a little something here for everybody and the food is consistently well made with good flavor.  As one of my colleagues described it, Mr. Wok is just what you expect from Chinese food - that's about as good as you're gonna get in North Texas."
"The food:Peking duck is amazing crispy and delicious when wrapped up. It's a good idea to reserve one before heading over, otherwise they may run out. They also make the rest of the duck into a soup or fried rice. Mango shrimp was good. Fresh mangos, wish there were more pieces of shrimp in it, howeverJapanese eggplant was tender and flavorfulFried tofu app was fried to perfectionOverall, everything I tried was good to amazingThe service:Prompt, friendly, helpful. Environment:Nothing to rave about. It's like a traditional Chinese restaurant. But I'd come back for the food and service."
"3.5 stars.I was so afraid that when I came to Plano that I would not find a decent Chinese restaurant. And I was kinda right and kinda wrong.I came here with a friend that was a strict vegetarian (no eggs/meat), and was very pleased that they are so accommodating here: essentially substituting any meat for no meat or tofu at your request on virtually any dish.  He ordered the Chow Fun with no meat and was more than pleased with it. It didn't look oily either like some Chow Funs can be.We started with these excellent Fried Crispy Tofu squares, soft tofu squares that were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and black sesame seeds and a tasty peanut sauce. Perfectly crisp and hot. Really good starter.I had the Mango prawns (one of the house specialties) and it was beautifully presented in a thin shelled fried bowl over crispy rice noodles. The only problem was that the fresh, sweet mango was so cold, that it actually cooled down the large prawns and the dish was oddly cool/cold. After having so many honey-walnut prawns that did not have this problem, it was unexpected to have this one turn out that way. That said, the mango was generous and very sweet, and the  prawns were perfectly done.The service was very friendly as well and there were lots of pictures of the dishes on display for the non-asians in all of us. They even had two versions of the menu (English+Chinese, and English only)The only nit pick was that I asked for a side of rice that was supposed to be fried rice, and the only thing fried about it was the color. It looked like they took steamed rice, sprayed it with enough soy sauce to make it light brown and then threw two or three peas and carrots in it to add color. It was not very good and I did not finish even this small bowl.I can't say that this place was very authentic but then I was not expecting it to be. I'd need to return to sample more of their dishes to be sure, but for now I'm rounding up to 4 stars."
"Absolutely great, I know you are reading my review but this is one out of many restaurant I would recommended to you HERE IS the reason whyFRIENDLY STAFFS: I'm telling you, they are so nice, not only they are taking care of you, they also make you feel like you are having a family meal.FOOD: I'm not saying they are the best I ever had but they are trying their best to provide you the best meal in the restaurant. (p/s: Manager will listen to what you have to say about your experience at his restaurant- share your thought y'all)Love this place:)"
This place is AMAZING! My husband and I will drive 30-40 minutes to fulfill our craving for this place. Our favorite is the peking duck and the cool wraps. You have at least 2 days worth of take home food too. Jack is super friendly and welcoming! He pretty much knows all of his customers very well. The staff is always friendly and ready to serve.  We will continue to keep coming here for many years to come. -Kimmi and Andy
"The duck is great, so is the new thin wraps that's much more authentic Beijing style."
"Fantastic Chinese food.  I tried the Rangoons, egg rolls, beef with broccoli and Kung pao chicken.  Excellent in taste.....Kung pao chicken could have been hotter but most Americans are weenies and can't handle it."
"Located on the east side of Plano in an unassuming standalone hole in the wall that looks like it used to be a Taco Bell or fried chicken joint.  Mr. Wok is a no frills kinda place, but plenty of culinary thrills.  The best Peking duck in the DFW area.  Love the table side finish of the duck, not too fatty and oh so good.  Order the buns to go with.  You also get the choice of soup or stirfry as a secondary dish from the duck bones.  I love the stirfry and gnawing on tasty bones, definitely the old school Asian girl in me.  And to top it off, it's BYOB!  Get out there.  It's good eats!!"
"It seems that everyone has heard of the Mr. Wok duck. It's their signature dish, served as a 3 course meal, but only if you get there in time! The duck must have renowned popularity because it was 86'd by dinner, even on a random mid-week night. But the fried tofu and ramen were still good substitutes! its BYOB, which is good or bad, depending on your preference. In case you arrive unprepared, the waitress noted that the gas station around the corner has a decent alcohol selection. IMHO, the decor could using some sprucing up. But the service was top notch!"
"Mr. Wok- I wanted to vomit after I left, but in a good way.This place is interesting. The building used to be a Pizza Hut and it still has remnants from its past which is amusing. I'm pretty sure the booths have been there since 1985, still very comfy. I would recommend reservations, this place isn't huge and gets very crowded very quickly on a weekend.We had the peking duck. I think some reviews said the duck had no flavor or was bland. I think where they are coming from is that the ducks they used (sourced from Long Island) are very lean. Without that fat, you get a different taste to the meat and even to the skin.  I prefer the fattier ducks since it makes the meat more moist and flavorful, but for a lean duck, this was very good. Definitely opt to pay a little extra for the steam buns for the duck; who the hell eats this stuff with tortillas? Weirdos. They also carve the duck for you which is nice- allows for lazy eating.We also had the mango shrimp, which was a nice switch, something refreshing after eating all the duck.  The milk sauce that is mixed with the mangoes might have been a bit much, made it a little too sweet. I would have preferred it without the sauce, but to each their own. And I still ate the whole thing up, so, whatever.Oh, I also ate all the crispy lo mein noodle things that came with my friend's soup at the beginning. Those were pretty good too, but I think it prevented me from eating a 5th duck bun.All in all, a fun experience with some tasty food. Not that expensive either, so that's always a plus. I think next time I'll have to try the beggar's chicken so I can bash the crap out of the loaf that the chicken is baked in."
Love this place and have been going there for years now.  My fave dishes are The calamariThe Chicken chahung& the seared edemameNo matter what I am in the mood for I order those 3 items. Yum. O and call ahead if you want the duck. it's also really good.
"I absolutely love this place. I first came here like 10 years ago, and the food has consistently been excellent since day one.My current favorite is the spicy parmesan prawns, they are spicy and delicious and just oh so good, and the great thing is they don't skimp on the portion."
"Came here for lunch, ordered Hunan chicken, nice sauce tons of veggies, we'll cooked, but not overdone, also had egg drop soup,  a little fancier than the normal fast food places, my only complaint is where's the chicken? My plate had micro pieces of chicken. But it's very tasty, rice was nice and abundant,  a little but not overly sticky"
"I have picked up take out from Mr. Wok several times and loved it.  Last night, my fiancee' and I went to dine in and liked it just as much. We started off with soup and an order of steamed dumplings.  The wonton soup is excellent and served in a cup size portion- perfect as a starter.  The steamed dumplings are filled with pork and cabbage and I love the sauce that comes with them. My fiancee' had the Four Treasures- Chicken, Shrimp, beef and pork in a garlic sauce served with noodles and really liked it.  I had the Cashew Chicken with fried rice.  The Cashew Chicken was the best I have had in a long time.  Compared to other Chinese places in the area- Mr. Wok is a bargain.  The prices are great and the restaurant is BYOB.  Will definitely go back soon with my family."
"This was our first time to try this place, but it won't be the last. Every item we ordered was awesome. The wok seared noodles were tasty. The shrimp fried rice was loaded with shrimp. Lastly, the Szechuan pork was just the right spicy and tasty at the same time.  We ordered both the egg drop and hot & sour soup. While the egg drop was excellent, the h&s needed a bit more cabbage and carrots to the broth. The place was packed an the service was still excellent."
"Please do not be fooled by the outside of the building, which appears to be a former Pizza Hut.  Mr. Wok puts people that judge a book by its cover to shame!I gave this place 5-stars because there is absolutely no other place in Big D that serves Peking Duck of this quality.  If you aren't a fan of duck skin, then this obviously isn't the place for you.  If you understand and enjoy the intricacy/complexity of roasting a duck, then this is duck heaven for you...Mr. Wok actually ships its all-natural ducks in from Long Island, NY.  They specifically use very low fat ducks to maximize the crispiness of the dish.  This is essential in Peking Duck!  It also prevents one from confusing juiciness with fat content, which is crucial PD mistake in many Chinese restaurants in the area.  The Peking Duck dish comes at around $30, but the owner slices up the skin in front of you, which only adds to the restaurant experience.  Afterwards, you have a choice of second dish by stir frying the remaining duck meat/bones or making a soup noodle broth.  Don't forget to call the day before to reserve your duck, because it's difficult to get them made-to-order.I also enjoy eating the ""Ton Chun"" soup noodles, which translates into homestyle noodles.  The soup broth is serious business--smoky in nature, which means that there is a long brewing process involved.  The noodles also come with julienned  vegetables and sliced, tenderized pork cutlets.  For the price, this huge bowl of soup noodles is a $7 bargain!Also, be sure to try out the mango shrimp and lettuce wraps.  Neither are outstanding, but great compliments to the PD."
"If you haven't been to this place, then you should try it out at least once. Be prepared though to wait in line if you haven't done any reservation. In this instance, my experience here was related to a friend who had a birthday party.We had several dishes family style, and I can vouch that every one of them was fantastic and tasted authentic. The peking duck is what the are known for and that was very good. Just to give you an idea, everywhere I have eaten Peking duck has had their very own signature.This location will bring the duck out and carve it there on the spot. The bun is fresh and so are the condiments needed. About the location though, ignore the fact that this used to be a pizzaria. Note that there isn't that many parking space, especially when its packed... and it was definitely packed that evening when I went there. Other then that, the staff was awesome and catered to our needs. I really like the place a lot and expect to show up again for Peking duck."
Best Peking Duck in Dallas! Went with my whole family and we all loved it.My Parents tried other dishes too and it all came out really good!. It's BYOB so we brought a bottle of wine. I have been trying to find a good place after I moved from San Antonio and finally found it we will be regular customers for sure!
Best Peking duck ever. Must call and reserve table in advance. They are alway booked. Super busy place.
"Peking Duck was excellent!The first course, that was....the second one (we had it stir fried) was just so-soBeggar's chicken was just ok....calamari was good, though a little saltyEdamame was really goodBut service, oh service, was BAAAAD-----underline BAAAAADthe waitress never bothered to ask us what we wanted or asked how we were doing....had to flag down the waitress three separate timesOnce to order foodSecond to ask where our beggar chicken wasThird was to ask where our duck wasFrom edamame/calamari, it was perhaps 20-25 min wait for the chicken, then another 20-25 min for the duck, then another 20 min for the stir-fried duck. Totally had to stop eating while waiting for the duck and chicken to come...intervals in between. Spent 2 hours (without actually eating the stir-fried duck, once it came, we asked for it to be put in doggy bag and left) in the establishment. And we came at 6.30 pm, when the restaurant was half-empty, so I don't know why we had to wait that long for the chicken./duck to come. Had made a reservation for the chicken 2 days prior.It looks like every table ordered Peking Duck without fail. So why we had to wait that long for the stir-fried duck, we didn't know....If you must have that Peking Duck, you can come.....but if you're limited on time, I'd advise you not to come here."
I would have loved to write a review on their food but here's their policy. They only make reservations for groups of 6 or more so DON'T plan of just showing up on a Saturday night and expect to be seated if there are just 2 of you.
"My family loves, loves, loves Chinese food. What do we eat at home? Chinese food. What do we eat when we go out? Chinese food. What kind of take-out food would you like? Chinese food. Would you like any other kind of ethnic food? Funnnnyy, go walk to McDonald's while mama and papa enjoy our Chinese food. :(Also- whenever my family eats at Chinese restaurants, it tends to be the same things:  some sort of soup, a meat dish (usually sweet and sour pork), a veggie dish (like a hot pot), combination fried rice, and fried flat beef noodles. Family full of adventurists willing to try new things coming to Mr. Wok, woo! (Note the sarcasm)Dad after a day of shopping: ""What would you like to eat?""...Yeah, okay.~~~~~~~Anyways, Mr. Wok was recommended to him by a friend who stated that their peking duck was phenomenal and that you had to try the restaurant at least once. This restaurant never would have stumbled across my father's radar of restaurants he would like to try if not for the said friend from above. It was a pretty early dinner (around 5 PM) so there wasn't any crowd at all and we were able to be seated fairly quickly. Service was great! We asked to be moved to a different table because it was right under lots of ceiling fans and we were accommodated to a booth when the table became available. Because this was a spur of the moment eating, we had no reservation for Peking duck or beggar's chicken, so poo...no duck for us. :( Actually...now looking at what we ordered, we actually did venture...kind of away from what we usually do...The food was ""eh.""First the fried rice and the yakisoba noodles came out and the presentation of the food was nicer than what I was expecting...except...IS THAT HAM IN MY FRIED RICE and you garnished it with pickled ginger?? Fine..fine. The yakisoba noodles were way too sweet and had to be eaten with white rice later on in the dish to help.Sweet and sour pork was plated beautifully too...except that I felt like I was being lied to. Sweet and sour pork. What do I expect in that dish? Sweet and sour pork. This dish had like..12 pieces (I'm being generous with this number) placed diagonally in a row  in a square plate with mounds of mushrooms, onions, and carrots on each side.What?! No Mr. Wok! No! Give me my meat! Steamed tilapia with a black bean sauce. Once again, plated beautifully. but why is there pork in this sauce? Too sweet, but the tilapia was very nicely steamed and was good. The sauce was a different matter. With the expectation of every dish being plated beautifully, they then brought out our fried duck. This dish was literally ""fried duck"" cut into pieces and pushed onto a plate and served to us. No garnish, no greenery under the fried duck to help with this shade of brown. Duck wasn't particularly flavorful and was on the dry side but I guess that's why they had the condiments on the side to dip it in. When comparing the prices of this Asian diner to other Chinese places, it is considered to be a bit higher (Probably paid ~$15 per person compared to the usual $8-9) for food that isn't considered worth it. Sure, it's still considered to be reasonable and cheap when compared to restaurant prices in general, but in the world of Asian restaurants, I do believe it is on the pricier side of average. Was the food worth the price? No.Was the service great? Yes! Was I wowed? NoWill I be back? Don't count on it unless it is to try out the infamous Peking duck. If 2 1/2 stars was possible, this would have been the rating I would have given. So my advice is to come here for the Peking duck but go elsewhere if you're craving more authentic Asian cuisine from other restaurants."
"We just moved here, and we were so excited to find a wonderful Chinese restaurant so quickly! The Peking Duck is simply delicious. Not at all greasy or boney. The Moo Shoo is also fantastic. Service is always wonderful: prompt & friendly without hovering. Prices are great, too. They don't serve alcohol, so bring your own. Atmosphere is very casual, and the restaurant isn't that large -- so make reservations or be prepared to wait a bit. But it's definitely worth it!"
"The Peking Duck with all the trimmings is curved table side by Jack the owner. The Chow fun noodles has that smoky taste. Quite a good place for a nice dinner at a  very reasonable price in a friendly atmosphere.. Service was quite alright  , though very busy on a Tuesday  at 6;00 . Weekends might be too crowded. Next time we'll try the Beggars  Chicken. I'm happy to find a new place  for food and value. We'llbe repeat customers for sure."
"Quack Quack Quack.One of the best things I've eaten in Dallas in a while......for $32, you get a Peking Duck served three ways- slow roasted and sliced, served with moo shoo pancakes, then stir fried with onions and some sort of greens, and then served in a soup.  Heavenly - the rest of the menu includes a stuffed chicken cooked 24 hours (Beggar's), a whole cooked fish, and a whole lotta other goodness.  Can't wait to come back."
"I'm not sure about the food. It wasn't bad just bland. The sweet and sour chicken was tasteless and the sauce wasn't sweet nor sour, it kind of had a chlorine taste to it, city water maybe? The beef and broccoli was excellent along with the chow mien. The portions were satisfactory as well. I might give it another shot but will try else where before I do."
"The one thing you need to know about this place is the Peking Duck.  You can't get this dish at many establishments in the area, and the fact that they actually know how to make Mr. Wok pretty awesome.  You will need to make sure you call in your order many hours before hand.  I would suggest you place your order in the morning because they need time to perfect this dish.  Their other stuff is decent, but there's honestly nothing special with their dishes compared to other restaurants.The decor is a little weird and you really do feel like you're in an Asian establishment as it's not exactly the cleanest place.  No worries as the aroma of your feast will overpower any strange scent you smell on your way in.  I will definitely be back soon!"
Best Chinese restaurant around my house. Love the food and great service it's always crowded so I always have to do take out!
"Soooo good! The place is a little outdated, but the food is among the best I've ever had. Service was excellent, price was very affordable. I highly recommend it."
Just spent 30 minutes waiting to be seated in a 1/2 full house...only to be told there was no seat available for an hour. What a waste. Terrible service. Was going here for a celebration dinner but will never be back.
"There aren't many places for Peking duck in the DFW area. This place, not only serves duck, but it is excellent. They serve it in two dishes-the second either being a stir fry or a traditional soup. The service is also dig-in fun. It is bring your own wine, and it is recommended to call ahead for your duck, but they usually have extras. Jack and Alison were great fun to visit. We will be back!"
"Hooooly DUCK. Didn't know ducks had that much protein...other places have always given me 80% fat and 20% meat. Mr. Wok proved me wrong. Following reviews, I ordered ahead and thank goodness I did, otherwise they would have run out. The waiter brought out the duck roasted to perfection and cut it in front of us. He plated the skin and meat and took the rest of the duck back to have it sautéed. (You can either have it sautéed or in a soup) this also was amazing. All in all, the pecking duck was ducking amazing, our waiter was helpful and friendly, the portion was perfect for two, and the duck was again...ducking delicious. I would suggest going on a weekday when it's less crowded. Again, order ahead! Will return to try the beggars chicken. Thanks Mr. Wok for the good duck experience. 5 stars and a happy dance from me!"
"I came here with a large group. We knew it would probably be busy so we made a reservation ahead of time. We got there early and they said we couldn't be seated until the time our reservation, which is fine. But when it's time for our reservation we go ask to see if a table is a ready and they said ""oh, we actually just put a group in the table we were going to seat you at. It'll be about 20 more minutes."" What! They let us order ahead of time before we sat so we got our food faster which is nice. But they messed up my order bad tried to say it was what it said on the menu, but they must have been looking at a different menu than me. The food was good but I the service was sub par."
"Don't get fooled by the physical appearance of this place.  Although it looks like an old Pizza Hut, the food alone will make you forget of the lack of decor.  I have dined here for many occasions last year and this year, and have not been disappointed by the food nor service.  It's BYOB here, they will provide you with ice and storage.  Food:  for the Peking duck, you must order this at least 1-2 days in advance.  The duck is crispy, and carved tableside.  For the duck meat, you have 2 options of getting tortillas or steamed buns to eat with.  For the left over duck bones that have alittle bit of meat still in tact on the bone, you also have 2 options eating that as well.  The server will carve the duck meat off of the bones, and ask you if you want to use the bones to make a duck soup or saute the bones.  Both options are good, if you go here enough times you should try both.  Mango shrimp:  this dish is slightly sweet from the fresh mangos that it is served with.  The shrimp is lightly battered, then fried and tossed in a mayonnaise type sauce, and served in a empty mango skin and a bed of fried glass noodles.  It's a spin off of the walnut shrimp at most chinese places.  Begger's chicken:  the chicken is marinated, wrapped in foil and then wrapped with dough that covers the entire chicken.  The chicken is then baked and brought out to your table.  You then get to pound on the harden dough to open up the chicken inside.  This dish definitely add entertainment value to your dinner, but takes a lot of work."
"Stopped here based on a recommendation from a coworker, and we weren't disappointed. Though the lo mein was made from spaghetti noodles (a pet peeve of mine), it was still tasty, as was my mom's almond chicken. Our crab rangoon appetizer looked a little well done, but they were ok none the less. Staff was nice, and the prices fair. We will be going back."
"my dad and i were super excited to try this place, given their ad in the chinese newspaper and how they were listed in dallas' top 100 restaurants (or something of that sort). after seeing the menu once we arrived, i was kindof skeptical because i've learned that generally, if your establishment cooks all of the various asian cuisines, then how good is the food? i decided to give mr. wok the benefit of the doubt, and my dad and i ended up ordering the two-course duck, marinated jellyfish, and ma po tofu. when the duck arrived, the waiters presented a whole duck and sliced the skin and meat in front of us, which made it look and smell all the more delicious. however, it was a huge, tasteless disappointment, especially at the price we paid and how popular mr. wok seemed, well, everywhere. the rest of the dishes were just the same: very, very mediocre. the ma po tofu was nowhere near spicy, and the marinated jellyfish was way too sweet. however, the point in our dinner when i decided mr. wok was just a no-go was when a fly landed on our jellyfish. disgusting, not to mention that it kept buzzing around our booth, too. when we pointed it out to the waiters, they didn't seem to really care that, well, there was a fly in their restaurant that would normally question their hygiene/health standards. the only part i actually enjoyed from the meal was the second course of the duck, the duck soup, which was very light and refreshing.overall, mr. wok was just a huge disappointment. the food was tolerable, but honestly i wouldn't come back. duck is way overhyped for what it's worth vs. what you get, and it bothers me that the staff seems so lax about flies in the restaurant."
"Mr. Wok what would I do without you?Although it's a bit of a trek from Uptown to get a meal at Mr. Wok, it's definitely always been worth it. The duck you get at Mr. Wok is the best you can get here in Dallas. It's perfectly cooked and the duck retains all it's wonderful and beautiful juices. The skin is crisped to perfection and the duck is carved expertly tableside. It comes with scallions, black bean paste, and chinese buns (no pun intended). You fill up the little warm buns with some crisp and juicy pieces of duck, put on a thin layer of black bean paste, throw some scallions on top and take a bite. The explosion of flavor and textures is ethereal. Then again, I've always liked duck so take that last comment with a grain of salt. They take the rest of the duck that's left over and will cook it for you 1 of 2 ways. 1. stir fry. 2. soup. Go for 1. It's much more flavorful and although there isn't a ton of meat left once the carving is complete, the stir fry flavor and little sinews of meat are worth the effort. As for the soup, it's bland and underwhelming.Did I ever tell you about the day I came here to Mr. Wok when they ran out of a duck? I was depressed for about a week. When I first heard they were all sold out, my heart sunk. When I saw them delivering the last of their pre sold ducks to other customers my heart shriveled up and died. Mr. Wok isn't Mr. Wok without the duck. You need the duck. The duck is a must. Let's say the duck disappeared. I woudln't come here."
"Went on a Saturday evening. Arrived at 6:20. I family waiting before us. Estimated wait for table: 90 minutes.I know the place is small but their policy of only accepting reservations for parties of 6 or more or for parties who pre-order the Peking Duck is ridiculous.I also do not believe that the entire restaurant was filled for the next 90 minutes with large parties and/or Peking Duck orders.I get the feeling, if you're a regular and the owner likes you, you'll get a table even without the above restrictions."
"You out there? Yes, you. The one reading this review. The one who is using Yelp because you are a rebel! You don't believe the hype your friends spew and you're skeptical of just how good something can be when clearly millions of people can be wrong (example: we live in a world where Martin Lawrence is probably plotting out the next seven ""Big Momma's House"" installments since he keeps getting funding for them). But I'm here to tell you that when it comes to Mr. Wok, the hype is justified. Believe it and see what all the fuss is about.My folks had gone here a couple of times already and after enough subtle hint dropping on my part that escalated into ""Hey, when do I get to go there?,"" I got my golden ticket invite to see what it is Mr. Wok does that makes the place so captivating. It all comes together pretty quickly when you hit the parking lot - the place is small enough to be charming but busy enough to warrant a sign that reads something along the lines of ""Extra parking in the Texas Bingo lot next door."" Yes, that's right - it is possible to blend awesome Asian Bistro food and bingo in the same immediate area. Add in the fact that the place looks to have been built into an old Pizza Hut, and the ""charm"" factor just exploded off of the charts. We walked in on a Saturday night (which is important to note) around 6:00 and the first thing that hit me was the layout: small walkway with bathrooms on the side leading in, kitchen to the right beyond that, and to the left a dining room of a few tables and those old school booths that are never as comfortable as you think they are. And the place was already filling up. We got a corner booth and set up shop with a pretty extensive menu.Mr. Wok's is BYOB, so keep that in mind if you're planning on stopping by to hopefully experience a raging kegger followed by fortune cookies. We set our beers on the table and our server was over faster than day. And speaking of our server... This girl gets points for not only being quick, knowledgeable and funny, but also for being quirky and not obnoxious. Seriously, take Zooey Deschanel, but make her likable, and add the dialogue from ""Juno,"" but make it tolerable, and you have this girl.And actually, everyone there was on their game. From food runners to drink re-fillers and a guy who managed to draw the shades at our booth without dislocating his arm out of his socket, everyone was engaging and amiable.But all this would be for nought if the food was lacking. And it is here where Mr. Wok's reputation shines. I'm not a lettuce wrap fan, which hurts my hipster cred, I'm sure, but they were polished off quickly at our table. Ditto the pork egg roll. And when it came time for the entrees, that was when I decided I would do my best to graze around the table as if I had never seen food before. I stuck with my chill garlic prawns, a dish that looks like it would be a disaster for anyone with facial hair (because it is) but no one should mind because it is that good (because it is). Finishing that off, I sampled the pad thai and was a fan, though not nearly as much of a fan as I was of the crispy beef. I considered ordering my own dish if not for the simple fact that dessert was on the horizon in the form of banana-chocolate spring rolls (please pause to wipe the drool) and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (ah, there's my hipster cred coming back to the limelight... and good thing, too, since that coffee was great). The point is, everything was exceptional.And I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the ""other"" factors at work here. Now all of this is heresy and rumor for me since I've been here once so take it in stride. The duck is -THE- dish here, and since business is booming, ordering one ahead of time is a surefire way to secure a reservation on the weekend... I believe. There are also meatballs that are not on the menu but can be prepared if given enough notice, and they knock the socks off of everyone in the building... I believe. And there's also a swimming pool on the roof where the girls from the camp across the lake relax... I'm almost 100 percent positive about this one.Bearing all that in mind, is it any wonder people continue to fill Mr. Wok's tables? It was a steady stream of patrons on our Saturday night visit and I'm pretty confident that's the norm most any other time of the week (except Sunday when no one is there... literally). Believe the hype, come for the food and make plans to do it all again."
Been coming here for lunch for years but finally got the family together for dinner and the famous Peking duck.   Came in with high expectations based on the reviews and they exceeded them.   Everything was great and leftovers the next day were just as good.    Will continue to make it in for lunch but will have to get the family together for the duck again.
"My bf's dad told us about this place and their Peking duck. We parked and thought, this place could be a hit or a really big miss. But don't be fooled by the look, or the non Asian girl being the waitress. Yeah, we had our doubts. But this place is really a hidden treasure. Sure, some of their stuff may be a little Americanized, but when it came down to the real stuff, it's really GOOD. Best Peking duck in DFW. It's a family owned business. They know what they're doing."
"One of my favorite restaurants in DFW! Whenever we have company in town this is our go to restaurant. The food is amazing and reasonably priced. A few of my favs are the duck, spicy beef, green bean and chicken, mango shrimp, edamame. The duck you need to call 24 hrs in advance. It's also BYOB! The owner Jack couldn't be any nicer and more dedicated to his restaurant. Try it you will not be disappointed."
"I have been here maybe 3 or 4 times total, 2 of those times for my friends Bday.  The same guys Bday both times.  The reason he loves coming here for his bday each year is that Peking Duck.  They do such a sick job carving that puppy.  They bring it out whole in front of you, the skin is so crispy and thin, the meat so nice as they carve it, its a wonderful sight to see.  The only down side of this is they often run out of duck, which blows.  Who would of thought there is ever a shortage of ducks ?!  There is like 30 of them out by the lake near my house, they just quack and piss me off at night.We had a reservation for 16 people total, and we had to share 1 duck, since thats all they had left.... which is probably the worlds hardest thing to do.  It ranks up there along with tight rope walking, nut checking yourself, and riding a unicycle. I guess it was our mistake since we only called that same day and all their ducks but one were already sold.   WHO SELLS DUCKS OUT BEFORE LUNCH ? WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THIS ?Anyways the mango shrimp dish was delicious, and so is the calamari dish.  I have no idea what its called, but we ordered 2 of those on our side of the table, and no regrets at all.  They are perfectly fried calamari with a nice spicy vinegar soy sauce mixture.  Tastes fantastic.  The restaurant is kind of in the middle of nowhere, by kind of I mean completely.  Its probably the last place you would expect to find a gourmet Chinese joint that specializes in Duck, which is quite expensive.  The dishes here are small but delicious.  If you ever go, PLEASE do yourself a favor and call in advance to reserve a duck.  For duck's sake, plan ahead.PS another hard thing to do is shoot yourself with a bbgun."
This is the second time I have been here. The service is excellent. We always get the duck and they always stand by the table and carve it up. We have a great time it's a great place to take your family and have fun please enjoy.  For the most important note the duck is absolutely phenomenal
"For the most part, this restaurant sucks.  How did it get 3 stars then?  Well let me tell you a story on my situation.  I was talking to this girl from the U.S. nation...The ""Chitty"" (and by chitty, I meant shitty) - - Mapo Tofu - This is not close to the usual Mapo Tofu I am used to ordering from Szechuan restaurants.  It came in a brown gravy type sauce instead of hot chili pepper sauce.  Bleck.  Only dish we didn't finish.The ""Meh...It's alright...but I'll eat it"" - - Cheese Shrimp - Parmesan crusted fried shrimp.  Meh.- Mango Shrimp - Not truly my cup of tea, either.  Somehow, the flavors did not mesh well for me.- Steamed Tilapia in Black Bean Sauce - Steamed because a girl asked for it steamed.  I personally wanted it fried.  Not the best tasting tilapia I've had.  Some areas of the fish were a little rough.  Not too much flavorThe ""Hey, I could get used to this"" -- Twice Cooked pork.  This dish had a very interesting flavor.  Basically pork belly deep fried, then stir fried.  Recommended.The ""WTF, that was incredible.  I think my balls just dropped"" - - Eggplant in Garlic Sauce with Pork - I AM A BIG FUCKING FAN OF EGGPLANT AT AN CHINESE RESTAURANT.  THIS EGGPLANT IMPRESSED ME THOROUGHLY.- Peking Duck - I have never had Peking duck like this before.  Duck was....BOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMBBBBBBBB.  So good...so good.These last two dishes took this place from a 1 star rating to a 3 star rating.  They put this restaurant on its back and took it to the house dou'...for Madden.So my recommendation.  Stay away from all the food except the two dishes I mentioned.Tip - If you don't want tortillas with your duck, just ask for the buns.  They have them for people that ask for them."
"Mr Wok is close to my office and I have picked up lunch from here many times in the past 9 years. I have to admit I like a smaller lunch, so I usually get their egg drop soup to go. For $1.07 after tax it keeps me full until dinner! They give you a giant bag of fresh fried wonton strips with it, as well as a fortune cookie, and I always get a small side of siracha. I can't speak much of their regular lunches as soup is my norm, but I will say the kitchen the clean, the staff are friendly, and it always smells wonderful when I drop in"
"Always a hit with my family. We have never been disappointed at Mr. Wok. Hubby's favorite is Ton Chung, which he adores.The wok seared edamame is wonderful. The staff and Jack are just the best."
"One dish says it all, the Peking Duck. Quite possibly the best tasting duck in all of Dallas. They bring it out to you cooked and slice it up right in front of your eyes, a unique perspective. The meat was flavorful and the skin was extra crispy. Wrap it with the flour tortillas (I prefer the traditional white buns but they don't carry them), dab hoisin sauce and scallions and you're good to go. The remains on the duck you can have them create a soup or stir fry. Make sure you reserve the dish a day in advance because you will be mighty disappointed if you do not reserve and leave without duck in your stomach.The spicy Parmesan prawns were ehhh. 6-8 prawns on that big dish seemed kind of a rip off. The taste of the dish was not very unique in my opinion. I would of preferred to have the chili prawns instead. At least you could of mixed the sauce in with the rice.Service was pretty good. I will be back to tackle the Mango Shrimp next time. P.S. I saw about 6 flies buzzing around when I walked in so bring your own fly swatter just in case."
"Stealing a line from Seinfeld ""it's the best Jerry, the best.""  The owner (Jack) knows how to treat customers, the price is more than reasonable, and the food is outstanding no matter what you order.  This is our go to place when company visits."
"I've been twice and the food was good....love that it's BYOB.  The owner seems friendly and comes around to say hi and help out. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the service is a little slow.  Both times we had to flag the waitresses down for napkins/ to order/ get a wine opener, etc."
"I so want this place to be good after reading all the rave reviews and personal recommendation from friends.  Sadly, It was a complete let down.  I was there for lunch to scope the place out before taking the whole family there to feast one weekend.  The friendly waitress seated me quickly.  I ordered the Sichuan shrimp lunch special and opted for Hot and Sour soup.  After tasting the first spoon of the soup, I detected slight bitterness, maybe some of the ingredients were burnt?   Then I guess the MSG started to kick in and made the soup tasted smoother.  The Sichuan shrimp came with very small shrimps, I don't know, 200 counts?  Put one in my mouth and a slight fishy odor hit my scent - shrimps were not fresh!  I tried to pick off the vegies but the sauce was too sweet.  I paid and left looking for something to eat.  Ended up getting double cheese burger for lunch :(  I wondered how can the same people who make great Peking ducks that people raved about, be cooking crappy food like this?  They must have different chef doing the ducks?  I have a friend who owns a restaurant in Richardson and he uses second string chef to cook during lunch.Place is located in the part of town that could use more rennovation.  Service was friendly and efficient.I will definite not come back to this place for lunch, but still on the fence about coming back for the Peking duck since it is spoken so highly by my friends."
"This is a small restaurant and it can be a long wait depending on the time and day you go.  So far, the only thing I like about this place is their Peking duck with the white small buns and also a crispy tofu.  We had tried a few different items on the menu, but didn't like it.  The prices are reasonable and the services are friendly and fast."
"First of all, we decided to try this place because of all the wonderful reviews.We made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night. We weren't seated until close to 9pm.We were starving and the entire restaurant was packed to the gills and there wasn't even walking space. If someone called the Fire Department, they would have shut them down. It was so dangerous.When we finally got seated, it was another 30 minutes wait before anyone noticed that we hadn't been served. We tried to wave down serving staff, but it was just too packed.  It was like Black Friday shopping.Some folks, I guess regulars, helped themselves to plates and napkins.My first advice is unless you come for the Peking Duck, don't bother. Everything else is American Chinese. Go to your local Panda Express for their other dishes.The Peking Duck is very good.  Come here for that and don't come back for another 6 months because you will have a heart attack from all the fat and grease, if you have another one any sooner.A good sign of an authentic Chinese restaurant is by looking at the ratio of Asian diners vs non-Asian.  It was easily 80% non-Asian.I won't be coming back."
"We tried had the Peking duck with buns, green beans, crispy tofu, fried tilapia and chicken wings. It was worth the drive from Fort Worth! A must try."
"The Peking duck is one of the most amazing meals I've ever had. The meat is juicy and tender and balances perfectly with the scallions and hoisin sauce in their made-from-scratch pancakes. It's served in two courses, first as an entree, then as either a soup or stir fry. They split it for us and made both second courses. Both were amazing! The egg rolls are the best I've ever tasted and the wok seared edamame is a unique treat. Service is top notch, and the bill always seems like a bargain for the quality of the food and service."
"Jack from Mr Wok does a great Job!  Really good Chinese food - probably some of the best that I have had in the DFW area.  We had a duck - it was soooo good - the stir fry that accompanied it was great as well.  I really like that the duck is served with the traditional pancake to wrap it up in and not that spongy thing other places use.  The eggplant and garlic - YUM - the mango shrimp- YUM - the Fried rice - YUM and the green beans with pork YUM!   Nothing but really good things to say.  The cuts on the veggies were consistent, which made everything cook the same, the skill used to slice the pork was spot on - just like its done in China.  The Duck presentation is excellent!    Make a reservation!! This place gets packed!  The service is spot on- the wait staff does an excellent job!  Its BYOB - so do just do it!  I really liked visiting with Jack, he took the time to come out and visit with several of the tables - this is not something that you see often.  Can't wait to go back!"
This place is the best place I have found for Chinese Food in Plano.  Great food.
"Favorite fast casual Chinese restaurant in DFW. Get the duck, sesame chicken, crispy tangy beef, or fried calamari! The owner Jack is very personable as well. He takes time to talk to each table and makes everyone feel valued."
"Drove all the way out here to eat on recommendation of my cousin and his family. I agree with all the other reviewers...the Peking duck is AMAZEBALLS. Fresh and well marinated, cut at tableside. The skin is crispy and tasty, but not overcooked. The meat is flavorful and blends perfectly well with their freshly made plum sauce and cut scallion strips. The buns to wrap the Peking duck are soft, fresh and delightfully warm from the oven. I did not like the beggar's chicken as much as the duck, but it was tasty as well. The chicken is stewed in a giant bread bowl for 22 hours with sticky rice, giving the chicken meat a soft, melt-in-your-mouth almost bite and a sweet aftertaste from the rice. My uncle got the honors of cracking the bread bowl open too. We also ordered two vegetable dishes cooked with garlic sauce. The veggies were fresh and flavorful very well. Definitely go with some friends because the entrees are pretty big. The entrees are served family style. This place is delicious!"
"Great food and service. They really make the effort to accomodate since seating is really tight here. For those parties of 6 or more or those that preorder a Peking duck,you can make a reservation. Otherwise on a fri or sat be prepared to really wait unless you come in way before the rush...the one time I ordered a dish and not to my liking..they were most gracious in replacing it with something else. I always over order and glad to have leftovers to take home.  My only peeve is the tea pot...wish it was cleaned and shined..kind of greasy...and.  yes it is byob."
First visit was fantastic; friendly staff and Peking Duck was delicious. We will be back for sure!
"I had the curry noodle, and my husband had the sesame chicken. My husband was more pleased that I was...mine was just greasy and had a weird after taste. Hard to explain.I will say most people were ordering the Peking Duck...majority of the place...but I would need to go back and try with another couple. If I do I will gladly remove this post and post better. But as of now....meh!Oh...and always ackward to enter and not know if its ""wait to be seated"" or ""seat yourself""....and this was something that was a problem for others as well. Large photos of food are ok....but sign letting new people know what you expect in simple seating would be highly appreciated."
Unfortunately horrid- I've never spit out Chinese before now. I got sweet and sour chicken with fried rice- rice was hard and sauce for the chicken was awful. Chicken was the only remotely edible part and it was mostly breading.
Had an excellent meal tonight.  We were lucky enough to get duck (normally have to reserve at least a day in advance).  Also Mango Shrimp and my fav Spicy Chicken in Peanut Sauce.   Service is fast and friendly and food is consistently excellent.  We'be been coming here for at least 15 years.  Lots of regulars.  The table next to us ordered and impressive dish as well called Beggars Chicken...I think you have to call ahead a couple of days in advance  for that one too.  They don't take reservations for seating.  Don't deliver.  Do take phone orders for pickup.  Yummy to the nth degree.
"Food is awesome. Really relaxing place. Try their noodle soups (ramen), its super filling and not too expensive. Owner is a really cool guy too. I'm still waiting to try the duck. I've seen it served a few times when I was there and I really want to try it.Friend had the coconut chicken. I tried a bit of it, really really good. Big portions too.Would totally go again!"
"After reading several reviews we had to try out this place.  It was a Friday night around 8:30 and I decided to call to see if they have any extra peking duck since you have to preorder a day in advance.  Luckily they had one left and we were on our way. The restaurant is located in an area you wouldn't expect a restaurant to be located.  The place is small yet intriguing.  When we arrived the parking lot was almost full (1 spot left) I thought to myself, we must be destined to come here.  When we got through the door we waited about 5 minutes.  The restaurant was packed but somehow there was one table for 2 available.  This can't be happening!   Our last yelp outing, we waited 2 hours.We orderedPeking Duck, Mango Shrimp, and the Han fried rice. The fried rice looked a little greesy but is was good. The Mango shrimp was also good but our favorite was the Peking duck.  As the owner carved the duck it looked  very lean and succulent.  The owner asked us if we have been here before and we said no.  He told us that we had the choice of a 2nd course (left over from the duck) of duck soup or stir fried duck (my favorite).  The said he will do both since this is our first time here. (very nice of him to do that). Both dishes were good. We liked that they put clear noodles in the soup.  Back to the peking duck... : ) We also liked that they offer both the buns and tortillas and they weren't cheap on the sauce and scallions (nub that!).  We were pleased with the duck but wish the meat was a little more tender.  By far the best Peking duck in the Dfw area.My only complaint is they serves warm sodas from a can. By the time I poured my drink into the glass the ice has melted and it tasted flat and watery.  This won't stop me from coming back.  I'll just order water.The service was great.  The owner and our waitress were really nice.  It's  very rare to find this type of service in an Asain restaurant.We look forward to ordering the chicken beggar (pre-order 2 days) next time.Thanks to all the Yelpers for making our dining experience such a blast!"
Those giving rave reviews have obviously never tasted good Chinese food before. Had the mango shrimp which was edible but not spectacular. Someone needs to tell Mr. Wok dirty dishes should be taken to the kitchen not kept by the entrance. I question the health rating on this place.
"Ok this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in DFW and as good as the ones in NYC Chinatown. Peking duck is a must it must be ordered a day before , everything was great, also love that's it is BYOB they will even open your bottle and supply wine glasses. Only problem is its not that big and gets crowded quickly, so get a reservation and get there early and you still may need to wait but can wait with a glass of wine."
"Went there for the first time last night. Wow jammed pack with customers. Great food. We have appetizers, main course and everything was freshly made and wonderful."
"Don't let the exterior fool you! It looks like an old Pizza Inn or something. With a lovingly hand written sign on the door that says ""Entrance"". It came highly recommended and it's BYOB, which is important to us, since we are in the wine business. I was skeptical, because we are regulars at First Chinese BBQ, which I think is killer! The interior is cute and cozy. It's a small place and the place was packed! On a Wednesday! NOTE TO SELF...MAKE A RESERVATION IF i'M COMING AFTER 7PM.We ordered crab Rangoon and the house cinnamon egg rolls. They were good but not mind bowing great. But the entrees were mind blowing delicious! A few that were note worthy were: orange peel chicken, crispy tangy beef, and Singapore noodles.They were all delicious! I highly recommend the crispy tangy beef. It was like a beefy pork rind in sweet and spicy sauce. Sooooo yummy.  But everywhere I looked, diner after diner ordered the Peking Duck! Except for the diners next to us who ordered a beautiful whole, fried, and sauced red snapper to share! Hell Yea! I'm definitely ordering that next time!And the Peking Duck!The service was great. Friendly and attentive.And the bill was a pleasant surprise. Definitely going back."
"Been here about twice and loved it both times and since I am Asian, I think my reveiw ought to count for twice what the other ""white people's"" reviews are. But, thats just me.Ambience: Its an old Pizza Hut and you can tell they put a little bit of thought into the decor. It wasn't a let-put-up-some-pictures-of-the-mainland-and-call-it-a-day. There is a copious amount of red in the decoration but that's cool because they are asian. I personally expected a gold painted stone foo dog at my table with me. But I will settle for good food. Everything is clean. The bathrooms don't make me feel like I am going to come home with a STD. All good in my book.Food: Get the Peking Duck. You have to call a day in advance and they carve it at your table. I have had the leftovers done both ways: fried and in soup. And I have to say I prefer the soup because then you are are not picking up weird, unrecognizable duck parts hoping you are not eating something that you normally wouldn't touch with a nine-foot-pole let alone put in your mouth. I mean, I am just sayin'. You should eat everything family style and completely over order because everything here is good. I like their Eggplants (that taste like beef - not everything has to taste like chicken), their calamari for appetizers, their curry isn't bad. But why would you order curry at an chinese restaurant? Their noodles are pretty awesome.Service: Thankfully they are not a completely asian-fied restaurant which means their servers don't come by, throw the menus at you and go ""whatchu want?"". The owner came by to make sure everything was dandy. No complains on this front.Personally, if you want some chinese food, you can't really go wrong with Mr Wok's. They have been gently Americanized so they are stuff that you normally won't see at the normal chinese mom and pop places and the prices are reasonable. You should grab some friends and order up some duck."
"Known for their crispy skin Peking duck but I also enjoy the fact that they bring out the duck and slice it super thin for you at table side. It's an experience! Other highlights include great service of friendly English speaking wait staff, clean place, fusion menu, and BYOB ( they have wine glasses, no corking fees, no drinking wine out of Chinese tea cups either) :)"
2 dishes:Peking DuckMango  Shrimp.Hands down. We love this place!
"I recently phoned in an order for some Mr Wok takeout, and I'm sad to say that the food was atrocious.  The service was pretty good, though.  Prompt and correct order taking, along with a quick follow-up when one of the noodle dishes was out.  Definitely can't do any better with customer support.  I just wish the food was just as good. Perhaps it was an off-night for the restaurant, but all of the food ordered (combination fried rice, pot stickers, chow fun, egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, etc.) seemed to be missing the following key characteristics: pleasant aroma, flavor, texture.  [I'll concede on the texture part, as this was take-out, and the containers usually don't keep crunchy noodles or fried foods crisp.]However, all of the food sampled had a strong pungent odor that smelled a bit like week-old chicken or dish cleaner.  The food tasted a bit consistent with the odor, and (while certain whiffs did remind my nose that this is Chinese food) made me a bit fearful that this sampling might run a number on my system.All the same, the search for a great Chinese restaurant in Plano keeps turning up some pretty poor results.  I have hopes that one day there'll be a restaurant which consistently delivers great quality Chinese food."
"Make reservations and call in advance if you want Peking duck.  We were lucky and they happened to have a few extra and we were able to call in on a Friday night and still come and get the Peking duck.  You can also opt to get the steamed buns (like gua bao buns) instead of the thin pancakes but they want you to order that over the phone in advance as well--they almost got angry with us for not asking for the buns over the phone.  The duck is delicious--it's lean and crispy and tender.  The buns are great with them and they are very generous with the portions of green onions and sauce.  The Peking duck is given to you in two courses--one with the meat and the other to make use of the bones: either stir-fried or in soup.  We tried the stir-fry which is basically the bones with the rest of the meat not carved on fried with Chinese salty pickled vegetables and a bunch of soy sauce.  It's flavorful but it was way too salty for my liking.  I wouldn't recommend it and next time, we'd choose the soup.  For $32, a whole fresh duck in two courses is a steal.We also ordered the mango shrimp as recommended by the other Yelpers.  It was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  For $12 you get a good portion of mango and about 8 fried shrimp in a small crispy wonton shell.  Cool concept but not worth it.To finish off the meal, we shared one order of sauteed green beans (only $6) but they really only give you $6 worth. It was a tiny tiny portion.  Barely enough to share for four people.  They were flavorful though...definitely not skimping on the garlic!  We also got the beef chow foon--pretty standard--but, we needed something to feed the toddler!The food is pretty standard except for, of course, the Peking duck.  The Beggar's Chicken also looks extremely intriguing and the smells coming from the one ordered across the room gave me some food envy.  I definitely want to try it next time I'm in Dallas.  But, they do require 48-hour notice.  (Pretty much, when you call to make a reservation, they want you to be able to order your entire meal. ;) )The space is crowded and not designed for the claustrophobic.  The atmosphere is hectic: huge parties crowd around round tables in the center, drinking wine (the restaurant is BYOB) and laughing, and then lots of parties of 2 to 4 lining the walls in booths designed to fit 1.5 people. Literally.  The restaurant is a bit dirty too--the windows by each of the booth tables have piles of dust that have seemed to accumulate over years of time and the curtains are distracting and dusty as well.  Definitely needs some more attention to detail in the cleaning department."
This place is awesome. Great variety of dishes and have had a great meal every time. Not greasy like other places and not too pricey. Great authentic Asian food!
"This place was ok. It failed a couple of my benchmarks that typically indicate a good Asian establishment (they accept credit cards, had no visible Buda statue at the front door and I also saw mostly Americans patrons). But the food was good. American-Asian I would call it, not Asian-Asian which is my typical preference.We followed the Yelp suggestions and had the Tangy/spicy beef. Not overly breaded and had crisp, fresh veggies.I was disappointed, however, they didn't have any thai peppers to make my dish spicy...I'm still trying to figure that one out...but it was a decent meal on the whole. One of the members of our party got the lettuce wraps and reported much satisfaction.The menu was extensive, lots to pick from.The service was fast and the server was friendly enough. She even came back to refill our teas twice, before it was essential. We plan on going back cause the Peking Duck looked AWESOME!! Something that needs to be called ahead.As I sat there, I re-read the Yelp reviews and I didn't see any black stuff coming out of the air returns. I didn't see any indication of an unclean establishment either."
"Food quality: Food quality is pretty good. I sampled mostly every type of dish (our table was a foodie crowd) from rices, soups, noodles, entrees, appetizers, salads and signature dishes. Rice dishes are colorful and contain many ingredients, but the rice grain is bland and not flavorful, a little soy sauce easily fixes this. The lo-mein had very thick noodles and the dish was a tad on the greasy side, but still flavorful. The ""orange chicken"" style entree was good, although the sauce was a bit too sweet and the breading (batter) on the chicken is too thick. The vegetable dishes I tried were all super good and fresh and looked spectacular. My table ordered the Peking Duck, the apparent ""hype"" plate of the restaurant and it did not fulfill my expectations. I was really looking forward to the duck, given the apparent hype around the plate and all the reviews that comment on how good it is, but it really is not that spectacular. Do not get me wrong, the dish is pretty good, but the amount of meat that the duck gives when carved is very little and some skin flakes are crunchy, others are soggy and too greasy. We chose to have our duck leftovers done in a soup (you can choose between soup or stir-fry) and the soup was very greasy, hard to eat (sifting through bones) and lacked substance. The table carving aspect of the dish has so much potential, but the way they carved it for us was neither impressive nor fun.Food presentation: Food presentation is pretty. What you expect from any good, Chinese restaurant. The style of presentation is communal, so plates are big and meant to share.Appearance of restaurant: Restaurant is a definite ""hole in the wall"" but the food quality is way above their looks. It has a nice comfy, authentic feel to it. It can get a bit crowded though on busy nights. Cleanliness can be greatly improved (small details and not overall hygiene).Service: Service is good. Nothing too spectacular. I do not have any complaints or praises.Value: This is where this place absolutely rocks. This is definitely a place to go with a small group. Expect to pay less than $15 per person to literally stuff your face with delicious and authentic food.In general: This is a pretty neat place to go with a small group to try authentic Chinese food. Value is amazingly good and the food will not disappoint. Sure, they could improve some things, but you will leave satisfied when you take into consideration the whole experience and not some minor details that realistically speaking restaurants of this caliber are not expected to fulfill.Note: This review is based on my years of professional experience in the food and restaurant business and reflects my personal opinion."
"Tried this place after seeing it being rated among D Magazine's Top 100 for 2013. I seriously doubt D Magazine's competency now after a lunch trip here.As other reviewers before have written, the place is a flashier version of Panda Express. The food is Americanized to the core, in flavor and spice. Don't expect anything authentic here. The Szechwan Peppercorn Chicken was bland, spice-less (after ordering extra spicy) and flavorless. The accompanying cup of fried rice was worse: dry & stale.I am not a Chinese but have eaten better authentic Chinese food around."
"I can't say much for other dishes but the peking duck here is awesome! I went to Mr. Wok with my friend for a lunch date and we decided, why not get peking duck?! The presentation was great, the waitress brought the whole duck out and carved it in front of us, and then they used what was left to make a soup. Honestly, the soup was a bit bland and I didn't care too much for it but the buns and duck were MMM delish!"
"Ate here this weekend with the hubby on the recommendation of a non-yelper friend whose food advice I trust :)  It had never particularly stood out on Yelp to me before but they deserve some more lovin'!We were actually on our way to try out Lion City when we remembered this place--I called to see if they had any extra Peking ducks available and even though they were pretty busy, they were able to accomodate us and put us on the list (even though reservations are for 6 people + according the sign we saw when we arrived).  The girl on the phone warned us it would be 15-20 minutes wait, but we didn't mind since we hadn't even thought enough ahead to reserve a duck!  We were seated in about 10 minutes, and got straight to the duck-ordering.  Service from everyone we interacted with was very friendly, and we especially liked that it's the owner who carves the duck tableside for you and makes conversation.  Now I have to say I am somewhat spoiled because the first time I had Peking Duck was on our honeymoon--we went to China and while in Beijing we went to the place that invented it.  Now THAT was an amazing meal.  I can't say Mr. Wok (or any other place we've tried since) quite measures up but I really liked it and we'll definitely be back to get it again.  And I will also say it was better than the supposed best place in Houston Chinatown (which is generally superior to the places in Dallas Chinatown).  The duck carved for us was fairly lean but very juicy.  Quite a bit of it was left on the bones, but it worked out well because we decided to try the stir-fry of the remaining duck pieces/bones instead of the soup for the second course because we had never tried it that way before.   The stir fry wasn't as tasty as the traditional duck preparation, but it was interesting and we were glad we tried it.  I will also second whoever else I saw commented that the crepes were basically tortillas, which detracts from the experience just a tad, but I think you can order steamed buns instead so we'll check that out next time.   The skin was nice and crispy but it wasn't as razor thin as it should be and still had a kinda thick layer of fat underneath.  Still tasted delicious but wasn't as crispy that way.  My only REAL complaint about the experience was that I had been vacillating back and forth about whether I wanted to splurge on dessert and had finally gotten pumped up about the fried banana eggrolls but our waiter brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  I know dessert is not typical in traditional Chinese restaurants and I'm sure I could have asked for it, but I took it as a sign that I didn't need the dessert, especially after 2 weeks of a food-filled vacation.  I'll get it next time :)So yeah...basically...go here.  We will actually call ahead next time because we want to try out the Beggar's chicken, and they request 2 days notice for that one."
"I have mixed feelings about this place.  The first few times we came, we really liked it.  But the last time we were there for Chinese New Year, it was a horrible night for both the restaurant and us.  They normally do not take reservations for 2 but since I was pre-ordering a lot of food, they accommodated us.  The place was packed and one table was complaining that they have been there for 2 hours and still haven't gotten all their food. So we were forewarn that it was going to be a long night. It did take 2 hours to finish our meal also. The waiter was very sorry each time he came by, we were like no problem.  I had pre-ordered the lobsters.  They were expensive and not good.  I was very disappointed.  They spilled HOT soup on us accidentally. Only got an apology, did not get comp or offer to dry clean our clothes.On other occasions, we had their peking duck and they were good. You have to pre-order and if you want steam buns, make sure you tell them when you call. The owner explained to us that they are specially flown in from NY and very lean.  The Beggar chicken was difficult to eat.  We didn't know we had to stir the dish well.  We ate from top down and it did not have much flavor at the top.  The family style tofu was really good, but it seems it is inconsistent.  Another time we came for the tofu and it was totally different than before.  The pork belly with preserved veg was good.  The place is very small.  It is best to go when they are not busy or holiday time.  From the outside, it looks like it used to be a pizza place.  Anyways you come here for the food, not the atmosphere."
"Whole Snapper - do yourself a favor and try it next time, the sauce concoction was mind boggling-ly good! The chef here is a genius, can't wait to try their Peking duck - this place is a hidden find, love their ambience too."
"Good decent Chinese good.  A tad greasy, but that's Chinese for ya.  It's the reason why my face is always oily...damn me for the things I eat! Didn't get a chance to order their special Peking duck but will def be back to get my grub on!"
Other than the Peking duck and some appetizers i didn't really eat anything else here and I have been here 3 times so far. The Peking duck itself is enough to make me want to come back again and again. :) It is really delicious. You can get either tortillas or steamed buns with the duck but personally  I think steamed buns is a better choice. I would advise to call them in advance for the duck.  It's a great place for big groups of people. The customer service is great and don't forget its a BYOB.
"We had a reservation at 12pm but we wait for another 1 hour and 15 mins to get our table. The lady sliced 80% of the duck to the table cloth and pick them up to the plate. When we  asked her to be careful, she stopped slicing and put the half empty plate to our table. We though the left duck will be stired fried and served us anyway but we were wrong. It came again with half empty plate for stir fried. How we know it? Everyone ordered duck that day and we have eyes. Service is awful there. I will not go."
Love this place. Great food great service and it's byob. Jack the owner is always  friendly  and cooks a great duck.
"The Peking duck is simply incredible. Haven't had the opportunity to try any other dishes, but definitely worth the trip....."
"Bland flavors. Woo point try again,  prefer to go to Psnda's to get something similar but with better taste . So go figure."
Guys...this place a diamond in the rough! Had my bday here with a party of 15. It was a first time for all of them and they ALL walked out impressed!Peking Duck (request the buns....it taste better)Mango ChickenBeggars ChickenThose are a definite must. Believe Jack's the owner. Pretty nice guy....even took a shot with us!BYOB as well
"Awful!  I don't think I've ever eaten such bland Chinese before.  Orange chicken not orangy nor spicy,  just a sweet ish generic taste with no depth.  Bell pepper beef,  no taste at all.  Lo mein, bland and oily. No taste no taste no taste.  Fried Rice tasted kind of burned.  How can you screw up fried rice? ?? Had great expectations about this place.  Alas,  no luck.  Not coming back.  Ever."
Awesome food!  Wait can be long but that's probably due to their great food.  Loved the Peking duck.  Try to get the guy to carve it instead of the lady.  The guy seemed to be much more skilled.  Everything we tried was good or great.  Definitely go for the Peking duck.  Make sure you call ahead since it's very popular.
"I've only been there twice for lunch with a group of folks and both times it was specifically for Peking Duck. But it was phenomenal. Each time I sort of wished we had left a few of them at the office so I could have a bigger portion. We ordered the bok choy as a side dish and it was great too. Attentive, professional service."
"I've been to Mr Wok a number of times in the past several months; most recently with my brother and girl friend over the holidays. I wanted to go to a place that was not stuffy, and was fun, as well as a great dining experience. To date, Mr Wok has not let me down, and all of the people that I've taken rave about the food, staff, and owers.Mr Wok has always been a great place to go with hordes of people. Of course I love BYOB venues, where I can bring lots of wine. I have a more detailed review on my blog, danesemeats.com/?p=468, but suffice it to say, I have always enjoyed most everything I've eaten there."
"Don't let the building turn you away. It's a hole in the wall for sure buy I was surprised by this place! The food is really good, and you get a ton for what you pay. It's really hard to find good egg foo young, but this place has it! We ordered food to go and it was ready in 15 minutes! Try the egg foo young and the combination lo mein, delish! Pork egg rolls are good and the crab Rangoon were fried to perfection. Definitely will be ordering from here again."
Yelper's Please Listen: This Place Sucks!!! I'm not a hater either.  Drove from Dallas to Plano to check this place out and what a horrible decision.  The duck was bland. I agree with everyone the duck is hot and fresh but it's flavorless. C'mon people 5 to 4 stars. The Chinese food is just as bad as the duck. I rather eat mall Chinese food. One waiter and one cashier = slow service! You will thank me later.
"Despite all the good review for their Peking duck, I was disappointed after my first and most likely ONLY visit.  Maybe I have high expectation for my favor dish, the Peking duck, since I did grow up in Beijing and weekly Peking duck is a norm for me.  If you never tasted authentic Peking duck, then the duck here IS pretty good.  For people out there who are seeking the real Peking duck, you probably will be disappointed like me.  If you really want to taste some pretty good Peking duck without going to China, in Houston there is a restaurant at the corner of Gessner and hwy 95, call Peking Cuisine (go figure).  Ducks there is very close to true Peking duck, sometimes order ahead is preferred.  My last visit, I think the dish was $35, which came with duck and soup.  Mr. Wok's duck soup is just so wrong.  Soup supposes to be white color (a very long cooking process that turns a clear soup to white soup).  Here is what a true Peking duck should be like (if you don't agree with me, then maybe you shouldn't try the Houston place).1. Traditional Peking ducks are very fatty, dripped with oil once it is cooked.  That is only because the methodology raising the ducks is very different.  Those ducks in China are called stuffed duck.  Each and everyday, instead of self feeding, people actually grab the ducks by the head and push a tube filled with food into the duck mouth and force the food down, making the duck very fat.  Now days, the fat ducks are not less popular, so leaner ducks are an option on the menu.  2. The wrapper should be paper thin, because its only purpose is to hold the duck, the sauce and the onion.  Steam bun or tortillas is actually not ideal.  Steamed bun is only preferred by southern and I never saw eating ducks like that until I come to America.  I use tortillas at home only because I don't know how to make paper thin wrappers.  Both over powering the taste of the duck.  The Houston restaurant has good wrapper.3. The black sauce should be sweet and the onion is typically white part only.  Both are used to cover or overcome the greasiness of the duck."
"Full disclosure alert. I was taken here by my friend Dave Gilbert, ex of Luqa and Lazare and fellow cooking conspirator. He knows the owners and suggested that I join him one evening for Peking Duck.It was damn good. The skin was perfect. The pancakes were a bit of a let down, though. They actually seemed more like tortillas than delicate pancakes.We, of course, had the soup made from the duck bones at the end - delicious too. terrific spicy eggplant, really good fish/tofu. rice bowls and I could have been in HK.The place doesn't have a license, so green tea was the drink of choice.As one might imagine, the service was impeccable, and the owner spent considerable time visiting - and even though Dave is a good friend of his, I didn't feel in the least left out.Great stuff.Oh if you are going to order the Peking Duck, do it a day or so in advance. It takes a while to make one of those suckers."
"I wasnt expecting to eat much because we had just had tokyo one for lunch, but as the food kept coming, I really couldnt stop. They boast of an updated interpretation of traditional chinese food, and they really do satisfy the taste buds of chinese-food purists like my parents. Peking duck- They carve a whole duck in front of your table. The skin is crispy and the duck is juicy. It comes with all the traditional condiments except their wrap is actually flour tortillas. Its definitely worth the $30 and its definitely a highlight.Mango shrimp- The shrimp and mango sit inside a crispy wonton bowl. There wasnt enough shrimp but the mango pieces made up for it. They were sweet, fresh, and was a good counterpart to the creamy sauce. Chicken soup- I think this is another one you have to order in advance and I'm not sure if its even on the menu. It comes in a big clay pot and they simmer the chicken for so long that the soup becomes milky. There are bits of ham for more flavor and lotus ""nuts""?. There were 6 of us and we still brought home 2 soup to-go containers full so this feeds a lot. The flavor of the soup was so robust and hearty. We usually dont eat very salty foods at home, so we asked for a cup of hot water to dilute. The waitress came back with the cup and also took a little sample back for the chef to taste so you definitely know they are really concerned about customer satisfaction and serious about controlling the quality of their food. I was really impressed!Do not be deterred by the pizza hut ambiance!!!"
"Vegetarians and vegans rejoice! There are so many choices on the menu, you'll have to take your time perusing them all.The peanut sauce that comes with the crispy tofu is good enough to involve espionage to figure out the recipe.A delightful establishment suitable for a quick lunch or a fancy dinner."
"Poor service (crammed parties of 8 and another of 7 with reservations) into side booths with a small end table despite 2 large round tables being available. One hour later a party of 7 (5 adults and 2 small kids - similar composition as the other parties) was placed in one of the large round tables. When asked, the usher replied ""I don't assign the tables"". For large parties, the table remains crowded with empty platters as the service personnels do not automatically clear them away. Service personnels do not refill empty water glasses. Overall one star for poor service.Setting is a converted ex-Pizza Hut building. Minimal decor inside and tables are crowded together. Overall one and a half stars for below average setting/decor.The Peking duck is on par with one of the street side vendors in Flushing, NY. Other dishes tried (mango shrimp, fried whole fish, tofu with fish, and shrimp noodle) are on par with the cheaper restaurants in Los Angeles, CA. Not on par with the better restaurants in the Orient, New York, or California. Overall three star for food quality (average)."
Peking duck!!!My family loves this place.Awesome service and food. Peking duck slicing & beggar's chicken service is somewhat of a show case and highly recommend bringing any visitors from out of town for a dining experience.Be sure to make reservations at least a day or two ahead as it says here for peking duck and beggar's chicken.Mango shrimp is awesome too.
"Mr. Wok is a gem in East Plano.  Must try the Peking duck (order a day in advance to ensure you get one) and mango shrimp.  Their duck doesn't have a thick layer of fat like other Chinese restaurants.  I also like lettuce cool wraps, cold noodles, general's chicken, calamari, edamame.  Everything is good on their menu.  Satisfies both authentic and westernized Chinese/Japanese dishes.  Prices are very reasonable.  BYOB.  Great service.  Worth a try!"
"Definitely a word of mouth sort of place. It's located in a somewhat run-down area in east Plano, and other then the parking lot being full on the weekend, you would never guess that this Chinese restaurant is one of the best in DFW.Like the other reviewers say, the Peking Duck, Beggars Chicken, and Mango Shrimp are excellent. Everything else we ordered was good but not exceptional.The service at many Chinese restaurants can be terrible when busy due to being understaffed. However, I counted 7 employees on our visit to Mr. Wok on a very crowded Friday night which is a lot considering this place is so tiny. The four servers were great. Our party of 10 (along with two other large parties) kept them quite busy but they were very helpful and happy to make us feel at home. The owner is also a very cheerful, social guy who frequently talked to the diners to make sure everything was great. You can really tell that the workers here are very eager to satisfy their customers.And it's BYOB, so bring your friends and family along with a bottle or ten of spirits!"
"Found Mr. Wok online and decided to go. Tried to make reservations for 2 but unless ordering Peking Duck, Beggers Chicken, or have a party of at lest 6 reservations not possible. Took a chance and went anyway and no tables available so the staff brought in a table for us. Mr Wok seems to be king of Peking Duck as we saw at least 8 served in the hour we were there. We ordered tangy crispy beef and shrimp in garlic and sweet chili and both were amazing. Staff was great and attentive. Highly recommend."
Great People .... Great food.... and BYOB!  My typical order.....Edaname....Peking Duck... (pre-ordered) Salt and Pepper Squid...All 3 are great and plenty for a family of 4.Jack takes pride in his family history of great food and his wife helps take care of customer service as well.  Lets put it this way.  We drive out from Arlington to Plano to eat duck.  Enuf said.
"My family and I love this place! But there are some secrets here that i am going to share with you, bc I love you. There are 3 things on the menu that you have to order 24 hours in advance: 1. Beggars Chicken- the presentation for this dish is unbelievable, i have never seen anything like it. This is a chicken that is wrapped in banana leaves and stuffed with 5 spice sticky rice and then covered in a dough and cooked for a whole day to preserve the flavor. The whole restaurant stops to watch as a huge ( like 20 pound) mound of dough is brought out to the table. The servers will let the people at the table attempt to crack the dough. After cutting open the dough and unwrapping the banana leaves, the chicken is finally presented. It is moist and flavorful. This is not my favorite dish, personally, I am not a fan of 5 spice. 2. Peking Duck- this too had to be ordered a day in advance, but they usually have some extras on the weekend. They start roasting the duck as soon as you get there and then they bring it out and carve it right at your table. It is served with ""pancakes"", scallion strips, and plum sauce. Amazing. You can then choose to have a soup made with the bones or a stir fry. The stir fry is the way to go. 3. Red Snapper- again, call ahead. I haven't had this one yet, I will def get it next time. More to come on that. The price is right, the staff is friendly, and the owner carves your duck or chicken at your table. I love me some Mr. Wok!!!!"
service was good. I thought the yaki soba sounded good the waitress said it was and she was right.  a nice place and I am picky
"I've had the pleasure of eating at Mr. Wok twice now and both times have been great.  For starters, the staff has always been friendly, welcoming, and attentive.The food selection at Mr. Wok is extensive.  They have a host of typical Chinese dishes as well as a few house specialties that you likely won't find anywhere else.  The Peking duck is very good and reasonably priced, though you have to plan in advance and order 1 day ahead.  I would have to recommend the wok-seared edamame each time you go -- it's inexpensive and absolutely incredible.  Other dishes I've tried are also very good, but these have stood apart from the rest.It's nice to find an independently owned stand-out restaurant in a sea of wannabes.  Give Mr. Wok a shot if you're looking for great Chinese food in a friendly, casual environment.  And it's BYOB, which helps keep the cost down if you plan to drink."
"Mr. Wok has become my family's new favorite go-to place for Peking Duck.  (I believe my parents go AT LEAST once a month)  My Mom was a little disappointed that Jack (the owner) forgot who they were as they were frequent visitors, but they were still glad he was there as they claim he is the best person to have for slicing up the duck!   We ordered the preserved vegetable beef (my mouth is still watering), the tofu & salted fish (okay) and the Kung Pao Squid (good, but my parents thought it tasted more ""western"" than asian)  The REAL reason they come is for the duck!  (you need to call in advance to make sure they have it and to reserve your own!) The peking duck is delicious!!!  They slice it thin and the skin is so crispy and full of flavor!  You eat it with hoisin sauce, tons of thin flour 'tortillas' and spring onions.  Mmmmmm....  The best part comes afterwards where you have the choice of eating the remainder of the duck in soup or stir fried with even more preserved vegetables, garlic and spices!  (we chose the latter)  The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and Jack is quite personable as well.  (my Mother adores him!)  The atmosphere is somewhat asian (I have a suspicion that it may have been a pizza hut in its former life) but still comfortable.  I'll definitely be back with parents and friends for more Peking Duck!!!"
"Long wait but the food is worth it!  I only get the Peking Duck here since it's the best in Dallas.  It can get a little noisy and crowded at times but once you take the first bite, nothing else matters.  I make my own special sauce that compliments the duck and bring it with me along with some beers and I'm set!!"
"This place sucks. Ordered tonkotsu ramen and mabo ramen. Not good. It's insulting that they can make this and call it tonkotsu broth flavor. Also ordered the gyoza, as a starter as stated in the menu, it came out last after we finished the ramen. The bill even came before the gyoza. Please do yourself a favor and don't come here.reply to jack:If its considered Yokohama-style, then why don't you write Yokohama-style and not tonkotsu.  FYI: it's pretty important.  I don't think a french restaurant would write ""foie gras"" and give customers a plate of bullshit.  If your ramen noodles are fresh, then why is it imported from Japan.  I think fresh usually means its made by hand for daily use. And thanks for apologizing for the sh*tty service for the gyoza. HIGH FIVE!"
"Mr Wok has an impressive menu of various Asian dishes.  This isn't a Chinese food restaurant, it's an Asian bistro, with many Asian countries represented on the menu.  My favorite is the Cha Han, a delicious, addicting rice dish.  My wife orders it every time. They don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own.  Mr Wok doesn't have high turnover amongst the wait staff, so they are educated regarding the menu, if you have questions.  I'd suggest this bistro to anyone who appreciates quality Asian food, and people whom like to try new things."
"I am writing this review to comment on their policy for reservations.  Unless you have a party of six or more or you order their specials Peking duck or beggar's chicken, you will not be able to make a reservation. So if you have a small group and you don't want to eat the specials then don't bother coming during peak hours.   We went here on a Saturday night for two without reservation and we saw all parties without reservation basically left.  One regular customer even confirm the difficulty of getting a table here.  But we thought we could tough it out as we already drove thirty miles to get to this restaurant.  After a forty five minutes wait, we were told that our table was getting cleaned.   But then once it was ready, they gave it to a party of six with reservation, and all these people were squeezed into a booth designed for four.   While the food did look good, we thought their reservation system absolutely sucked.  They should do a first come first serve or take reservations for all.  There are plenty of other authentic Chinese food in Richardson so won't bother to go back."
"Introduced Mr. Wok to yet another set of friends and once again it was a huge hit.  Peking duck was delicious as usual, but also fabulous tonight was the whole friend snapper and the Cantonese crispy noodles."
"If you like Peking duck, then you'll love Mr Wok!  Being originally from Houston where you can readily get bonafide Peking duck, I was skeptical about trying this place out.  I'm glad I did though because it didn't disappoint. They carved the duck in front of us and then gave us a choice of stir frying the meaty bones or making soup with them (do the stir fry, it's pretty darn good).  Legit establishment with a very friendly staff in a cozy atmosphere."
"So after hearing about this place and read the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  What a disappointment!  The Peking duck is very bland. Tasted more like boiled duck.  The tangy beef was way too saucy and not even crispy like the description.   Don't know whether because they are short on staff but service is super slow.  I would not recommend this place.  If you like Peking duck, go try tasty china in garland, much better!!!"
"I have to admit that I was a bit surprised . Walking up to the restaurant , it looked like an old run-down Pizza Hut .  And the parking lot is horrendous .  And inside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall , but once the food came out I was amazed .  We shared three orders of Peking duck ( which you have to pre-order 24-hour in advanced ), 2 orders of mango shrimp , beggars chicken  and lots more .  What's also great is that it's BYOB !  I was a bit surprised at the appetizer sampler .  The appetizers looked like something you would find at any fast food Chinese restaurant .  But overall I liked this place a lot .  Definitely something I would bring my parent to !"
"I love Peking Duck and this restaurant in Dallas is the closest we've come to find that offers authentic PD style ducks in north Texas.  Most of the other Chinese restaurants hasn't come close here at all but Mr Wok nailed it for us after years of searching.  After the duck is stripped of meat, you get a choice of either soup or stirfry from the leftover bones - nothing wasted.  I prefer the stir fry bones just so I can chew on the leftover bones.  We'd give it five stars if it's just the ducks but unfortunately other dishes kind of miss the mark.  If you want Peking duck then this is it - five quacks.  Other dishes are meh (tried the fish and the beggar's chicken and a couple others, passable but nothing great that stood out).  You do have to plan for the duck and order and reserve your seat a day in advance.  Oh and bring a good bottle of wine as it's BYOB."
The pecking duck and beggars chicken is the best their. The pecking duck is the first course and then you get an option of soup and something else with. The beggars chicken is magnificent but you have to order it 3 days before!!
Had dinner with the family tonight - tried both their Peking Duck and Beggar's chicken after all the raves from family/friends.I was a bit underwhelmed (maybe i was oversold and had high expectations).  The Peking Duck was good - crispy skin and not fatty!  The Beggar's chicken was a bit of a disappointment.  The flavor was a bit too herbal and the chicken seemed overcooked.Had a few other dishes:  mango shrimp - nice pieces of mangos and good flavor;  eggplant with garlic - ok..I guess you can't go wrong with eggplant;  pork with tofu & jalepenos and crispy tangy beef - forgettable.
"Being from NYC,  I am used to great Chinese food.  Unfortunately this place is not one of them.  The noodle soup was utterly disgusting - soggy noodles and soup with absolutely no flavor. My wife is Japanese and even she couldn't stomach not than 2 bites.  Also tried the Moo Shu pork which was not good.  The only OK dish was the Chinese green vegetables.Trust me,  anyone that knows real food from the coasts will want your money back.  Come if you want to be ripped off."
"One peking duck served 12 of us, and we ordered 3 of them.  I ate 5 servings myself.  My wife told me just because everyone else doesn't eat at lightning speed like me, doesn't mean they aren't planning to eat more.  Hey, you snooze, you lose.  Best peking duck and BYOB.  We will be back."
"Dallas's best peking duck.  While the peking duck is awesome, everything does not seem to be authentic Chinese.  Kinda weird the the peking duck is made authentically but not the other dishes I've tried.  But I have to say I have only tried about five other dishes.  I have tried what seems to be the second best dish there which appears to be the chicken in this big whote enclosure that they let you smash.  The Peking Duck alone makes it 4 star if you love peking duck!!!"
"Second visit to-go this time.  My son had a hankering for ramen and he wanted to try the miso ramen.  Soup is deconstructed to-go and you get to put it together when you get home.  All ingridients were very fresh.  Noodles were excellent, my boy gave it a 7 out of ten - way better than deep-fried grocery store purchased noodles. Fried banana spring rolls were a hit again...we'll be back"
"Quite inexpensive for a place I didn't think was all that great.  It's a little better than your run of the mill chinese joint pushing General Tso's chicken, but not worth the extra imho.  Try a Vietnamese joint or something more interesting next time you want Asian, there's plenty around (surprisingly cosmopolitan) Greater Dallas."
"I have eaten here 3 times.  I really wanted to like it because it is a mom and pop place not a chain and it is close to my house.  The food is ok, the service is ok, but the place is DIRTY!  They really need to remodel - there is filth everywhere.  Don't look at the air vents in the ceiling - there is black stuff hanging out of them.  The bathroom fixtures have dirt embedded in the grout and caulk.  It is too dirty to clean - just need to paint, tear out the fixtures, and start over."
"I love the Duck!  It's not like most places where it comes with a thick layer of fat below the skin.  They cook it a special way so that the fat is melted off during the process, leaving a crispy skin and juicy meat!  I really enjoyed eating it with the sticky buns and making mini duck sandwiches out of them!  But definitely order the buns first!  It takes a while for them to bring it out.  They will ask you how you would like the leftover bones cooked after they finish carving it.  You can either get them stir fried or made into soup.  I've only tried the stir fry so far and was very happy with my choice.  It makes great leftovers as well!  We also ordered the Mango Shrimp which was ok.  I thought it was a bit too sweet but it was still tasty.  I would recommend trying to go with a group of 3 or more if you get the Duck or Beggar's Chicken.  It's a lot of food.  If not, go anyways and take leftovers home with you!!"
"Never write reviews, but this place is a little gem that is mainly known through word of mouth so wanted to share.   Was not a Peking duck fan until a friend insisted I try it here.  I've since tried duck all over town and hands down, Mr. Wok is the best.  Golden crispy skin, no fat, and succulent meat carved tableside.  Be sure to pre-order duck or you won't get any. It's a fun, lively, casual little place in an old Pizza Hut building.  Nothing fancy, just really good food.  Its been a big hit with all the friends and family we've brought too.  Service is friendly and personal -- you feel like family.  BYOB so bring your favorite booze."
"If you want the freshest peking duck.. you gotta come here... you wanna have a little fun.. you gotta get the beggars chicken.  the food is superb. You get a fresh duck carved in front of you, then either stir fried or made into a soup.  The mango shrimp is to die for! All in all, great fresh food for a great price! make sure if u want the peking duck to order 24hrs in advance. the beggars chicken must be preordered 48 hours in advance. they slow cook it with stuffed with sticky rice in banana leaf for 22 hours!  The owner, Jack also serves you and a really nice guy!"
"Save yourself a trip if you're here for authentic Chinese food and the Peking duck. The ""Chinese food"" served here is beyond Americanized, even compared to Panda Express. But hey, we are in the U.S. so that's totally understandable. Now onto the duck, it was a major disappointment because if this is the best duck we've got in Dallas, then I guess I might as well crossing Peking duck off my to-eat list going forward. All dishes I've tried ( 2 separate trips with over 10+ dishes ordered) are all on the overly salty and sweet side, and they just taste like they have the same base sauce no matter what you order. I would have given the place a non-star as a Chinese restaurant, but judging from its patron group it seems like its flavor suits the American taste buds hence the 2 stars."
"Our waitress was okay, but honestly that is normal for any Chinese restaurant. I grew up eating at the same chinese restaurant  for 30 years. I moved to texas a couple of years ago and haven't bothered to look for a replacement...Chinese food is not a hot item out here. So glad i came here for the Peking Duck.  I love Duck and this did not disappoint.  Perfect crispy skin and super tender meat.  The the stir fried pieces were awesome.  The prices were sinfully low, usually i paid twice this much in Los Angeles for great Chinese food. BYOB saves you another 25% on your bill. The guy that runs the place was super nice.  The decor is lacking and there are a lot of large loud families, but i am still looking forward to going back.  The only people that should be questioning the authenticity should be from china. I am from the san gabriel valley which is 75% asian, and this was pretty darn good."
You've never had Peking Duck until you've been to Mr. Wok. They only use the best duck and the skin is cooked to that tasty crispy perfection. I've been there multiple times and the Peking Duck never dissappoints. You should definitely arrive hungry. Their portions are good. The Peking duck is a two course meal that just keeps on giving and giving. Make sure you order the duck 24 hours in advance.
"If you want to eat here do this immediately:1) Call and make a reservation2) Reserve a duck early in the day3) BYOBThis place is a complete mad house at night and if you don't have a reservation, you are not going to sit down.  In fact, you will stand and be bumped into by waiters and waitresses.  But, if you do sit down and order some food - this place is magical and you forget the surroundings.  Best Peking duck in town.  However, I am going to take off 1 star for the spicy parmesan shrimp because it cost something like $16 and we received.... about 7 small (though tasty) pieces on a giant bed of lettuce.  Come on people."
My husband & I were introduced to this restaurant by our Chinese friends.  The food was authentic and good.  The place was packed but the service was quick.  We had the Peking Duck after reading all the reviews on Yelp.  It was good.  We will definitely go back there soon.
"My Japanese wife has spent the past six months scouring the Metroplex for her favorite dish - Ramen.  When she first came home from this restaurant she smiled to me and said ""I found it!.""On my trip here we had calamari, ramen, Asian spaghetti, and Japanese chahan (fried rice.)  The calamari was good and we enjoyed the sauce.  The ramen was good.  (So good that my wife suggests this restaurant almost every time we consider going out.)  The chahan really tasted Japanese.  I would be surprised if someone in this family hasn't spent a significant amount of time in Japan.     On a side note, this place was established by a father and passed down to a son.  I've seen lace of inter-generational talent ruin so many fine family businesses that I am impressed when it is done well.  I never ate here when the father was still in charge, but the son does things really well. Kudos."
"I visited Mr. Wok today for lunch on the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers.  That and the fact that it's almost close enough to my office to walk.I probably ordered the wrong thing... I got the Hunan Chicken with Fried Rice & Pork Eggroll.  The food was good, although from the cute little pepper next to the item I ordered... I expected some heat.  There was no heat at all...even my fellow wimpy mouths could have eaten it.I also noticed that the patrons of Asian decent were given a 2nd menu from which to select their meals... I was only offered the regular menu.  There were quite a few people eating from large bowls full of broth and noodles, so I believe I need to go back and try something else.At 1205pm this place was packed today.. and the only open table was a huge round table designed for an 8top with a lazy susan.  I was also a tad turned off by the fact that I had to walk to the ""expo counter"" in order to pay.  Seriously... people don't need to be standing at the counter watching the waitress fill plates with rice."
Excellent Chinese! Family owned. Orange peel beef is out of this world. My favorite spot for lunch.
"Their cha han is hands down the best fried rice in the metroplex. I first sought this place out because I had heard it had good ramen (pre-Ajisen era).  The ramen was fair, but there was nothing particularly notable about it.   And then I tried the cha han-- perfection.  Flavorful without being greasy.  There's actually an entire Japanese menu, but I've never managed to tear myself away to try anything else."
"its true that service is great, very friendly .. but food wasnt really that great. or atleast what we tried... vegetable lettuce wrap and peppercorn chicken."
"What an amazing Peking Duck.  I had read reviews all week and also on yelp and made my reservation for our duck.  It did NOT disappoint!!  Probably the best Peking Duck I have ever had...ever.  Our group of 4 arrived hungry at 11:30 and by 11:45 the place was full of diners.  Nearly everyone had the duck and it was just amazing...juicy meat, crispy skin, hot tortillas to wrap it all up.  And the most amazing was the soup afterwards made with the remaining duck bones.  Did not expect it to be anything special and it was awesome with flavor.  We tried the sampler appetizers and they were very delicious as well as the green beans that were smoky and very flavorful--a perfect counterpoint to the rich duck.  We will be regulars from now on!  YUM!"
"If you like American Chinese this place is better than the rest.  If you like real Asian food there are many better places in Greenville Ave.  Everyone seems to like the Peking Duck, which I didn't try, but one dish doesn't make a restaurant.  I really wanted to like this place but it failed my test, I was in the majority, i.e., there were more non-Asians than Asians eating. Very, very ordinary!"
"As far as local mom and pop places, it doesnt get any better...we met friends for dinner and had ordered several items:  fried tofu, edamame, water spinach with garlic- all terrific!  I am vegetarian, so the rest of the table shared peking duck, then  sesame chicken, pork with salted vegetables, mango shrimp and a sauteed peking duck dish with the ""carcass""- all looked phenominal.  everything was so fresh and you get huge quantities to go home with.   At 8 PM on a Thursday we got the last parking spot and the last table- this place is a gem"
"The low review is for the atmosphere, not the food.   The food was amazing but I would recommend take out only unless you are with a large group that can make a reservation.   Without one, expect a 30 minute to 1.5 hour wait during peak dinner times.   I was there with my boyfriend and after a  30 minute wait, we were finally seated at a small table for two in the middle of the dining area right in the path of the wait staff.   We spent most of the evening ducking whenever the wait staff came thru as the area was so crowded they literally had to bump into us and hold the trays over our heads to make it to other tables.   The servers seemed to cater to the large groups.  I think we spent about 15-20 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order."
"Having read the reviews of other yelpers and having just finished watching bangkok dangerous (a terrible move) we had a hankering for asian cuisine and headed to Mr. Wok on many positive reviews.We had a mix of japanese and standard chinese food that was all well prepared and served quickly. We got there early, around 6pm, and watched as the restaurant filled up with regulars by 7pm. We had dumplings, potstickers, orange beef and ramen noodles,  watching a movie that bad made us pretty hungry. We also got a pork egg roll and a cinnamon beef egg roll as i've never heard of or tried a cinnamon beef egg roll.The dumplings and potstickers were good but I'm not sure if they are made in house, I still prefer jeng chi in richardson if I need a dumpling fix.The orange beef was good flavorful but not overly sweet or spicy. The Ton Chung ramen soup was very good and very filling. I will say that the orange beef is served a single serving portion and not the heaping platter you will normally get at a chinese restaurant so if your planing on sharing make sure you order enough.The pork egg roll was your standard egg roll and very good. The cinnamon beef egg roll was good, but different. It a sweetness that the cinnamon provided that I can't saw I look forward to having again but I wouldn't refuse it if someone offered it for free.All in all, it was a nice meal and close to big M little urphy  and we would go back again."
"This place is really an under appreciated gem.  They have great flavors, courteous service.  I love the mushu chicken and the duck and authentic ramen noodles for lunch."
"I've had amazing Chinese food in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York and this place is up there with the best. The food is fresh and inventive and the service is flawless. I couldn't recommend it more."
"Our favorite Asian food by far. We've been coming here for years. Try the specialties and avoid the basic stuff. Crispy tangy beef, mango shrimp, and Thai curry are the best. It's great food."
"This one is real easy. The food here is very good.  First, the edamame is seared on Mr. Woks Wok and has a great taste.  Second the calamari was as good as anything I have tasted in Spain or Italy.  The pot stickers were some of the best in the city.  The Duck?  The Peking Duck was simply brilliant.  Carved at your table and the bones are then used to make stir fry and or soup.  We did both and they were great.  I highly recommend Mr. Wok."
"I've gone to Mr. Wok more than a handful of times & have always had a great experience. By far the highlight is the Peking duck since this restaurant's known for it in the Chinese community. Remember to request this at least 24-hours in advance so they can have plenty of time to prepare it. Then again, he usually has a few extra's just in case. The calamari appetizer's just the right texture to start off your meal. The hot & sour soup (family recipe from what Jack said) is tasty as well. Also, the mango shrimp is indeed flavorful. Checkout their variation of edamame with soy sauce (wok seared) along with the Beggars chicken (whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice & then the chicken's wrapped in dough). When you're in the mood for something soupy, I'd recommend one of their Japanese/Chinese noodle soups. Soft noodles & tender meats yet so healthy with all the vegetables along with the flavorful broth.Along with great food, there's also great service especially from the owner, Jack. He not only wants to make sure your food's flavorful & delicious, but also your overall experience is pleasant. It has to be good if little elementary school kids are writing to thank him! :-p Every time I've gone there, he always has a big smile on his face regardless if the place's busy or not. That's always a good thing to see right when you walk into a restaurant."
"Great peking duck, can't say that any other dish that i've had is worth mentioning.  would like to try the beggars chicken some time."
"We went with friends who are regulars here. I am so glad we did. It's hard to find good Chinese food in a city that is being taken over by poor buffets. Mr. Wok is in a class by itself. Our dinner was great from appetizers to dessert. We had edamame, dumplings, and crab rangoon. All were better than anything we've had lately. All the dinners were delicious. I know this because we all had to stick our forks in everybody else's meal. You can't help yourself, because the presentations are enticing. Not fancy, but a lot of eye appeal. Dessert was a yummy banana and chocolate chip roll. It was fried to perfection. Not a drop of oil on the plate. The kitchen is more than willing to adjust recipes to meet dietary needs. My husband and I did not leave a crumb on our plates .As an added bonus the prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is BYOB. Service is outstanding.  I highly recommend Mr. Wok."
This place is awsome. I believe they recently remodeled and are now calling it Mr Wok Asian Bistro.  The inside is much nice than the outside leads you to believe.  Great ambience.  The food is excellent. My favorite dish that I get every time since I was a teenager is the Seasame Chicken. They do it really well here.  I am an adventerous eater so when I eat Seasame Chicken at a place with regularity that is saying something.  Go Mr Wok...and the owner are cool for sure.
"I admit that I had my doubts coming into this place. Coming from California, I would say that my standards for Chinese food are also pretty high. Still, Mr. Wok surprised me.We ordered the edamame, yaki soba, and peking duck. The edamame, traditionally boiled, was stir fried. It brought out the aroma of the soy beans but also took away from the nutritional value. The yaki soba was terrible: soggy, sloppy, and mixed with the wrong sauce. The peking duck is one of the restaurant's specialties. So special that you must call in and reserve one--first time I had heard of this.The duck is brought to you fresh from the oven and carved table-side. First the skin, then the meat. The remaining parts can be either stir-fried or made into soup. We chose the former, and the experience is akin to eating ribs. Meanwhile, the meat and skin are mixed into a pancake (think tortilla) with oyster sauce and green onions. Overall, this was definitely the highlight of the meal. The duck was large, flavorful, and well-prepared. If I had to nit-pick, I would say that it was a tad dry.Service was very good on a day when the house was full. Oh, and this place is BYOB. And the owner's a cool guy."
"Mr. Wok better Wok himself over to Asia. The food was OK. I mean OK, nothing special but definitely cleared my plate. I ordered the sesame tofu and the flavors were right but not the texture. when cooking tofu in replacement of meat you normally batter it then fry it so there is some crispness to the pallet. At least in my standards. I love Asian cuisine of all types and am excited to try their pad Thai. A nice plus to this establishment is that you can sub out meat for tofu in any of their dishes. The tofu appetizer was cooked well, now only if they could incorporate that into some other dishes. I sound like a broken record, tofu, tofu, tofu, come on guys give me a few more options on your menu. I realize veggies aren't prevalent in TX but at least Cwok down the street had a pho-duck. On another note, It could of been the fact that i had take out but the portion was kind of small for 6 bucks. Overall I will probably eat there again but I won't be going out of my way for it."
Awesome Peking duck and mango shrimp! Not pretentious and just a great restaurant with good food.
Best Chinese in Dallas / try pot stickers and mango shrimp // this place is the opposite of a PF Chang's in the sense its real good not chain Chinese food.
definitely one of the best bowls of ramen in town!
We heart Mr Wok!  Owners Jack and Amanda are a lovely couple and so much fun to hang out with! We love love the shrimp with mango dish. So good. We're definitely going back again and again and again
"Went to Mr. Wok for the first time, we were seated promptly but were not served at all for over 1/2 an hour!  We were actually ignored while the staff fussed over another customer right next to us.  We saw entrees being served, condiments given, tea refilled all the while being ignored.  Finally someone came to us saying they were not a wait-staff, but had we been served, we said no, they apologized and we ordered appetizers.  We ordered salt and pepper calamari and hot and sour soup.  The soup was cold and the calamari was chewy, we should have known better and just left but we ordered anyway.  All the dishes tasted the same with one exception, the shrimp and mango which was outstanding.  Too bad the service was horrific, we will never go back again and we left no tip as this was the only recourse we had against such terrible service.  Shame on Mr. Wok for being so indifferent. I have never written a review before bit felt compelled to do so now because I would have given this establishment years of dutiful patronage if only they cared enough for every customer."
This is hands down the best chinese restaurant I have ever been to. I've been a regular here for several years. Jack the owner is one of the nicest guys I've ever met. General chicken is incredible! Everything on the menu is mouthwateringand will not disappoint.
"This is very good and authentic peking duck.... everything else not so much. This is a very Americanized place, but very yummy My love the beggar's chicken, but the wife, not so much. Also the eggplant in the garlic sauce is awesome. Probably the best I've had in DFW.Make sure you make a reservation, because this place is always full"
"We were looking for somewhere with authentic, tasty duck which wouldn't cost an arm and a leg and we found it here, at Mr. Wok. Having been here a number of times with family and friends for duck, we know the drill that you have to call 1 day in advance to reserve for the duck and 2 days for the beggar chicken.  We arrived after 7:30pm on a Friday night and were pretty much seated straight away. This place had great duck, but the beggar chicken in my opinion is just for fun and not really for taste.  If you have never had Peking duck before, I do believe this restaurant does a great job of providing a great first experience. They serve/slide the duck skin and meat right at your table.  Mr. Wok is known for their juicy duck meat combined with crunchy skin, chopped green onions and sweet hoisin sauce wrapped inside a thin, crepe-like covering (they call it pancake but you can substitute for buns if you prefer that instead).  To have a real Pecking Duck experience then you need to go to this restaurant.  It's also a BYOB restaurant so feel free to bring your own favorite wine and beer to pair with their delicious dishes."
"If you're reading this, and have the ability to drive/walk/run/helicopter over to Mr. Wok restaurant located in Plano, TX: my word of advice is STOP READING AND GO NOW!Sidestory: My go-to for Peking duck was a spot in Northern VA (where I grew up); This was where many celebrities, locals, and politicians swear by. Up until my recent visit to Texas, I had thought that place was as good as duck gets...Boy, was I wrong. Dining at Mr. Wok, was not only hands-down the best peking duck I've ever had, but also one of the BEST dining experiences in my life.I came here with my boyfriend and his parents on a Saturday evening. Reservations are needed I believe if you want a peking duck, so call ahead to make sure. We started off with various appetizer dishes such as eggplant (delicious), spinach, and another vegetable dish. All were fresh and prepared well.When the duck came out, it looked amazing. It tasted very fresh and was cooked and sliced perfectly. One duck easily fed the four of us, so I suggest sharing with a group of 4-5. You can ask for the steamed buns (highly recommended!) to make-your-own duck buns with the hoisin sauce and greens that they provide on the side. Everything about the duck was delicious and the buns were really soft. One other awesome thing is that they don't waste here; you can choose to have your leftover duck and bones to make a soup or stir fry. We had the soup, and it was a really good complement to the whole meal. TLDR; Mr. Wok is one of the best places you'll find for peking duck. Try it out!"
"Finally made the stop to Mr. Wok and I'm regretting that I didn't go sooner. As everyone said, you must reserve the duck or Beggar's chicken either a day or two days in advance, respectively. We went on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't full or anything but toward the end of our meal, it started filling up. We reserved the duck earlier on the week and didn't have any trouble.In addition to the duck, we ordered dumplings and sesame chicken with fried rice. The dumplings were interesting. The outer skin was thick and I don't think it was steamed all the way because when I took a bite, it was still a flour-y white. It definitely wasn't the best dumpling I've had but I can tell it was made in house and not from a frozen bag. The sesame chicken with fried rice came a little bit after and it was super good! Very flavorful and the pieces of chicken was tender yet crispy even drenched in sauce. The fried rice that came with it was interesting. Not your typical fried rice but it was still tasty with the chicken. Finally the Peking duck came out (I think it took about 20 minutes or so since we sat down). The man who carved it out for us explained to us how it was marinated and he quickly carved the duck skin first then the meat. He placed the skin and meat on another plate and asked if we wanted the leftover duck stir fried or soup as a second course. So be warned that when you order the duck, it is a two course meal! We got the stir fry and it's basically the duck carcass so lots of bone fried in a sauce with mustard cabbage. It came out super fast and was flavorful but difficult to eat because of the bones. The Peking duck itself was delicious! The skin was crispy and the meat was moist. The sauce really helps bring the flavors to the buns so don't go easy on it! You also pick between pancakes or buns at the beginning. We picked the buns, obviously! Definitely worth the trip here at least once. The people were super nice and the experience was one that you don't to have much."
"If you like Peking duck, I would advise checking out Mr. Wok!  Probably one of the best places in Dallas for this. Be sure to call ahead and reserve it a day in advance. The restaurant itself is small and tends to get packed so call ahead to make reservations to avoid a long wait. They bring the duck out and carve it table-side for you. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender and delicious. It also comes with steamed buns or pancakes, green onions, and hoisin sauce. For the second course, they give you the option to use the bones in a soup or stir fry which they will prepare and bring out to you. (5/5)This place is BYOB which is also a plus. I've always left happy and satisfied! Highly recommend!"
"Very delicious. The duck is roasted then fried. Very crispy skin. But after frying, it is a little bit too oily. If it is just roasted in oven could be perfect. Very good portion. One duck can make three different dishes: Beijing duck, duck bone soup, and stir fry duck bone. Only 35 dollars in total. Very good price for a delicious meal! And good service. Customer can even bring their own wine!! Recommend!"
"Well, they know me by name, so you can draw your own conclusions about my regular stops there. Mighty busy on Friday and Saturday nights but they still manage to whip out a To Go order for me. Amongst my favorite dishes are: Eggplant with chicken or pork, Spicy Green Beans with same. Need to try their Peking Duck and Beggars Chicken."
"I was asked by my new coworkers what I wanted for lunch today. I said Chinese. Chinese was a very good choice..The General Tso's lunch was cheap, fast, and came with a hearty beef egg roll. Probably the best tasting chicken I've had in a long time. It was hot, juicy, fried to perfection, and the sauce was amazing! I might have to pick up some carry out before I head home after work, while I'm still training in this Plano area.."
"Mr. Wok is a cozy little unsuspecting Chinese restaurant in East Plano that is often praised for having the best Peking duck in the DFW. You have to order it 24 hours in advance. Another signature dish, the famous Beggar's chicken, requires a 48 hour notice. The Peking duck was just okay (for lack of a better word). I expected super moist, super tender, super juicy...and it was none of those things. What it was was very average. I do appreciate the fact that they don't waste the remainder of your duck and use it to make a second course. We opted for the stir-fry VS the soup. Not a bad flavor to the stir-fry but there was hardly any meat seeing as most of it went into our buns so maybe the soup would have been a better option. I also felt we didn't get enough buns but oh well. The Beggar's chicken is definitely cool in terms of presentation. It's one of those dishes that you order once just to say you tried it - not something I would get again. It's a fun dish to get with a group so that someone can hammer on the bread that encases the dish before your server actually cuts it open for you revealing a whole chicken wrapped in leaves. I am slightly confused seeing as the menu said it was a whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice amongst many other things mixed into it. When the bread was cut open, I only saw chicken. We mixed it around some and couldn't find any sticky rice. The overall flavor was a little underwhelming. Pretty unmemorable. Overall, I found Mr. Wok to be overhyped. The dish that everyone raves about is nothing spectacular. While this wasn't my first time having Peking duck, I wouldn't proclaim myself as a Peking duck connoisseur. The service was great though."
"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with the family.Pros:Surprisingly decent prices.  I was expecting higher but was pleasantly surprised.Good portions - plates were fairly big and we definitely had enough foodTaste was on point.  I felt like most everything was what it should be or better except one dish the twice cooked pork could have been better.  The pork had bones and was super dry.The steamed rice was well cooked, and I'm glad it was free.Cons:  The service was a little lackluster.  The waiter could have been a little nicer and showed some more initiative.Overall I would come back.  Food tasted pretty good and good portions."
"This place probably has the best Peking Duck in Dallas.  It is two courses. The first course is the traditional skin and meat with the steam buns, hoisin and scallions. The second course can either be the duck soup or stir fried duck bones. Must reserve this a day in advance.  I assure you that you will not be disappointed.  They also have the traditional Chinese dishes, which are great depending on what you like, but again, do not come here unless you order the duck."
"Always a good meal here, although it can get cramped.  Therefore, always try to make reservations for dinner or even lunch.  And if you want Peking duck during the weekdays, you have to call ahead and reserve the duck because they make only so many. Peking duck here is a must and I would say it's one of the best in town as it's not greasy and really crispy.  You can select between a pancake or bun. We prefer to eat our  Peking duck with the buns. Then you can select between a crispy stir fry or soup for the remaining duck meat and bones.  Go with the stir fry as it's a very flavorful and satisfying dish. A few of my other preferred dishes are the sautéed green beans, mango shrimp and poached tilapia work bok choy. Service here is top notched.  As busy as they get, they always try to be fast and not show that they are not being overbearing."
This is a very standardized Chinese restaurant. nothing fancy here. The portions are reasonable and the food is really delicious. I am not sure why its always empty i think the location is not the best. Its very clean and like i said earlier the food is really what you'd expect from your typical chines restaurant.
"BYOB :) Delicious and flavorful food. Love getting the family style options with bigger groups, but today  I noticed the lunch prices on the back of the menu and omg I need to come back sometime soon and get an individual entree. I have loved everything I've ever tried there so far and I will def be back soon."
"Wanted fried rice for dinner tonight. Open Yelp app and went off recommendations. BingoFirst time here at Mr Wok. Parking lot was full and over flow next door. The place was packed and people waiting. The place smelled awesome, all that wonderful food coming out of the kitchen. The price was very reasonable for fried rice, l will be returning, they have alot of items that will fit my diet.ConsNo utensils ln my to go order. l will let that slide."
THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN !!!  Ingredients are fresh... sauces are not saturated with MSG...  Jack the owner is really friendly and treats everybody like family.  Great service.  My family and I have eaten there at least once a week for the past several years.   All the dishes are delicious and very reasonably priced considering there's a lot of care that goes into preparing them.  Highly recommend it.
"First time here on Saturday and it definitely won't be the last! The duck here was delicious! Crunchy skin and succulent, tender meat...it was so mouth-watering good! My group ordered ordered two ducks and for the duck bones, we got them to do both the stir fry and the soup. The soup was great but the stir fry was even better! The nice thing about this place is that if you don't want to order duck, they have a regular menu as well that offers plenty options. Oh, and it's BYOB, so bring a bottle of wine, eat some duck, and have a good time!!! :)"
"Oh man. Every other time I go to DFW I go here and get a Peking Duck and stuff my face with it. There really are no other words of the joy that my mouth feels. It's like the happiest Chewbaca, but like MORE. You know how sometimes when you have a secret it's like even more precious and joyful. It's like a secret joy. It's contained inside. Okay, stop this nonsense Sarang. Anyways, point being, it's great. Food is fresh, it's not a huge place, it's one big room with booths around the edge and tables in the center, probably not much more than 25 tables, but it stays pretty full. If you want the Peking Duck, call ahead and they'll be sure to reserve one for you. Next time, I'm gonna need to go with 4 people because I want to try the Beggar's Chicken but not at the cost of not having the Peking Duck. MMMDELICIOUS."
I was very disappointed. After all the reviews i had really built this place up to be let so far down.We ate tonight Wednesday about 5pm only 1 other customer when we arrived.All the items we ordered had so much filler vegetables or fruit very little meat (see pics) I got the signature dish Mango shrimp there were 5 shrimp and about 2 full mangos so much mango made the dish entirely cold.  Daughter got the Mongolian beef not spicy at all and i would say about 1/4 cup meat rest was vegetables then hubby got the curry beef with a complete full onion and what tasted like dried peas not fully hydrated. The fried rice was not fried at all it was older rice chewy mixed with soy sauce nothing else.  Nobody came to check on us for drinks or how we were doing at anytime. Very disappointed and will not give a second chance was not worth it.
"Before our Chinese born roommate left America for a life abroad, he wanted to show us what Peking Duck tasted like. True, he was inspired to show us this because of an episode of Hannibal, but we appreciated the gesture anyways. If you're going here for the duck, make sure that you call in ahead of time. And one duck is best to be split between 3 to 4 people. Trust me, those little things end producing a shitload of meat, spread across 3 courses of preparations of them. I seriously wish that I could remember the names of each concoction throughout the meal, but the taco-like part was my favorite, followed by the soup. And, as the large group of Chinese business men sat down at the table next to us, we learned two important things about Mr. Wok. (1) It's BYOB. This group of 10 businessmen probably had 3 cases of beer with them, so shit was 'bout to get rowdy. (2) The local Chinese clientele in the Plano/Richardson area approve of the food and how it's presented at Mr. Wok. That is priceless when deciding where to eat.All in all, this place was so fantastic that I'm having cravings right now, and I rarely eat meat. If you're looking for Peking duck, this is where to go in the Plano/Richardson area. Everything is expertly prepared, cooked, and presented."
Really juicy and delicious Peking duck! Skin was crispy and at the same time it melted in my mouth.  If you order the Peking duck they will either stir fry or make a soup with the left over.  Mapo tofu was also excellent.
"Mr. Wok is hands down my number one place to go for Peking duck. With table side carving of the duck, it's a guarantee you'll get that crispy skin you came for in the first place! If duck is not your thing, there are plenty of other dishes that won't disappoint. Try the ""Crispy Tangy Beef"", another dish I get all the time.This place is small so be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations. It seems like it was a Pizza Hut at one point that have been renovated into a Chinese restaurant. Parking is also small but they allow parking at a nearby lot just down the street."
"I was soooo excited for this!! I heard about this place from 2 different people- they also advised that we needed to set a reservation on a duck at least 8 hours ahead.I set a reservation a day beforehand with a pleasant woman and we arrived at 745PM and were sat about 5-10 mins after. It seemed very busy and hectic but our server was super nice and friendly!We didn't get anything besides the duck as it was a 2 course entree and there were only 2 of us. Good thing too, we couldn't finish everything!The owner came out with the duck and started carving quickly while the aroma filled a bubble around us. omgsh it smelled SOOO good!! After he finished, he asked us how we wanted our second course- stir fry or bones soup. We asked for both so we got half portions of each!We also opted for the buns (between buns and crepes). The buns were so fluffy and white! I was a little disappointed because the buns were pretty cold by the time the duck was set on our table-carved and ready.They brought out the buns super early too. It would have been AMAZING if the buns were hot. But that's my only takeaway on the first course.The duck skin was so crispy and fatty and delicious!! The meat was so juicy and I enjoyed every single bite!! The stir fry was with some bitter/pickled cabbage which I'm not the biggest fan of. I didn't like this too much except that the duck skin was even crispier which was so much more amazing!I liked the soup more because the taste of the cabbage was a bit more muted and not as overwhelming. Bottom line: The peking duck here is absolutely amazing. The service is fast and friendly. And between 2 people- 20$ for a very very filling delicious dinner? Worth."
Mr. Wok never dissappoints. Get the seared edaname and pork dumplings for starters. Peking duck is a must for first timers...followed with the soup. Green beans are excellent too. I liked combo fried rice as well and makes good leftovers. BYOB!!!
"I would rate this more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars overallll. Came here for my sister's boyfriend's birthday and I really enjoyed the low key, family style portion sized Chinese food. The restaurant use to be an old Pizza Hut which I was able to visualize after being told so. Parking spots are very limited and confusing so just keep your eyes opened due to the confined space. We ordered sooo many dishes and I love the fact that it's byob (poppp as many bottles without feeling guilty...lol). My favorite out of the 6 dishes (wish I knew the correct names) was the Peking duck, vegetable noodle soup, and this sautéed green onion with beef. Now I'm sure you've noticed how popular the Peking duck entree is according to the past reviews so make sure you preorder the duck at least 48 hours before dining at the establishment. I really liked the buns and crepes intended to consume with the duck. I feel as if the Peking duck was somewhat on the bland side. I wasn't very impressed with duck ... maybe I set the bar too high? I really enjoyed the authentic step up from ramen vegetable noodle soup dish which is large enough to share between 4 ppl (as an appetizer of course)!Overall: I thought this place was mediocre. I'll probably return but most likely won't. I was pretty disappointed after my first time dining at Mr. Wok. Hopefully, it'll all change after my next visit."
"Could've easily been a five, but the ridiculous wait knocks it down a star. We had a reservation at 7:30, and didn't get seated until 8:30...why offer reservations then?! That perplexes me til this day. But the manager was very apologetic and offered us a free appetizer because of the wait. I was still a little annoyed by the wait, but the food made me forget all about it. We got 2 of the Peking Ducks, and it was out of this world! They do a tableside carving, so you get a meal and show all in one. They serve you the meat and skin with steamed buns and tortillas. Then they make you either a soup or stir fry from the leftover bones. Talking about getting your money's worth. We got one of each, and I prefer the soup over the stir fry. It was just refreshing after all that meat and carbs! The stir fry wasn't all too bad though. It was just a lot of heavy eating. Safe to say I was in a food coma afterwards. The duck was moist, the skin SUPER crispy, and the service impeccable (except for the wait, but it was a busy night so I'll let it go). This place is an hour from us, yes an hour. So probably won't be coming back in the near future. But definitely will have to go back to try out their Beggar's Chicken. You have to call in advance to place the order though since they don't make extras!"
"This is a really unique place.  You can get good Chinese food in a lot of places, but none of the other ones I have ever been to can do a DUCK like these guys.If you call ahead, you can order a Peking Duck that will knock your socks off.  Not only do they serve it in a really cool way, they will make fried rice, soup, and other things with it after the table presentation.It looks like an old pizza hut from the outside (it was one) but don't let that fool you.  They are always busy and the food and service are why.  It's also very reasonable for a great place.Jack is the GM and he's super friendly and professional.  Don't miss this place."
"This place has great reviews on yelp so I had to try it out. If you want to get a seat, especially during the weekends, you have to call for reservations ahead of time. Sometimes even a day in advance.We were seated right away. The restaurant itself is small. The building kind of looks like an old Pizza Hut, but they decorated it pretty nicely in there.They have a full menu but what great is that the menu tells you which dishes are their Signature Dishes. I would recommend ordering any of their signature dishes. My crew ordered the Peking Duck, the Sesame Chicken and the Banana-Chocolate Spring Rolls. There are certain dishes you have to reserve a day or two in advance such as the Peking Duck and the Beggar's Chicken. My crew loved the Peking Duck. They cut it into small pieces in front of you. You eat it with pork buns, a sauce and vegetables. They take the remaining pieces and make it into a smaller dish with vegetables and a soup. I personally didn't eat any of the duck because I don't like duck. However, if it counts at all, my crew ate all of their dishes to the bone. I ate the sesame chicken. The dish was ok. I really should've ordered something with more flavors but it sounded good on the menu and it was a signature dish. Not too many different flavors with the sesame chicken. The dessert was pretty good. Super crunchy and sweet. Plenty of banana and chocolate in each bite. It comes with a caramel dip. All in all this place is pretty good. Everyone in the room seemed to be in awe of the two signature dishes...Peking duck and Beggars chicken. It was pretty cool how they presented these two dishes. As for the other dishes on the menu, I wasn't as pleased. I can only say for the sesame chicken but I wish it had more flavor. The dessert was bomb though. I would definitely recommend eating here!"
"Wow!! From the outside and inside you can see Mr. Wok doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. This is a hidden gem tucked aside for those adventurous to search for. Do yourself a favor and end your search for amazing food here. Grab a group of friends, reserve a table, and reserve a Peking duck!Coming all the way from the Oak Lawn area of Dallas to Plano I expected nice food, but I have to say my mind was blown!! Now I used to live in Houston and visit their Chinatown all the time. I know what great food is and this my friends is great food!! Honestly one of the best if not the best Peking duck I've ever had!! We had our duck cut table side by the owner himself, Jack. The explained how the ducks are marinated the night before and cooked fresh when you order it. Jack shared with me a secret that makes the duck skin extra crispy and the mean lean which I'll just say I'd have to agree that it works. The skin is crisper than others and the meat lean.The remaining duck meat on the bones was then used to be stir-fried into an equally nice dish. Lots of flavor with one of the several ingredients Jack shared being garlic. We also had the Mr Wok sampler of appetizers which was tasty, but thinking back I wish I had more belly room saved for the Peking duck.There was plenty of parking and seating when we came but it quickly changed and was packed with a line and little parking by the time we left. I'd recommend having a reservation or coming early. Long story short: great service, legit food, and cool experience."
Best Chinese food hands down in Plano Texas. Get the duck and try the second portion stir fried. The dumplings are the bomb.
Made reservation way advance for my moms birthday. Very busy  hole in the wall. The place is very crowed to get around. Not handicap friendly. It was difficult to guide my dad around in the wheelchair. I felt bad to ask people to move for us. We finally set down and it took and hour and half to get our pecking duck. We order some appetizers and it took 30 mins to get it. We also order other side dishes and they missed two dishes and we told  them to cancel it. We can't wait any longer. The service was horrible. The poor kid was running around frantically. There was two server and one person to cut the duck. Way under staff. The owner seems she doesn't care at all and stay at the front and not help the tables. The waiter just ignore our table and didn't greet us and just ask rudely are you ready to order. The food was fantastic but the service was down hill. Will not come back until they figure out their wait staff.
"I came for lunch and the service and prices are awesome! Lunch meal is $5.75 - $5.95 for egg roll or egg drop soup, entree and rice. I subbed fried rice for white rice. I had the Szechwan beef. Sauce was great with a lot of veggies. Unfortunately, not much beef which I understand for the price. It was a HUGE portion so I had the leftovers for dinner. I chose the egg drop soup instead of the egg roll. It was a different broth and consistency than what I'm used to but thought it was very good. It also included some veggies which was a great surprise. Also had an order of crab rangoon that was eh. Not terrible but not fantastic. My coworker had the pad thai which he did not care for but this is not a Thai restaurant. Stick with the Chinese dishes. I will return for lunch and try new dishes. For the price, how could you not?!"
"I saw great reviews on Yelp and was so excited to try the Peking duck. However, after trying the duck, I felt deceived and duped because it was terrible. The meat was dry and extremely bland. They cut off about 50% meat off the whole duck in front of you to eat with the buns, then they took the remaining to the back to make you a ""second course"", which really is just the chopped up remains and stirred fried. See the picture here -- it looks as bad as it tasted. I was served white rice with the duck but the rice was old, cold, and hard. On top of the bad food, the place was filthy. I looked up the ceiling and there were dusts formed all over the place. It looked like they haven't cleaned in decades. We sat by the window and the blinds were just as filthy. If the front of the restaurant is like this, I can't imagine how dirty it would be in the back. All in all, this is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. It was a waste of money! $35 for a dried up duck.9/9/2016 - this is in response to Jack's (business owner/manager/duck carver) comment to my review. Hi Jack, Thanks for your response but your assumption is incorrect. I'm used to flavorful & tender duck meat even after the fat has been rendered. Yours tasted like you didn't only strip the fat but also everything else with it. All I tasted was a doughy bun with hoisin sauce filled with rubbery duck meat. I understand that you might not like negative feedback but please don't proceed to imply what I'm used to in order to undermine my review. Every Yelper has the right to express their opinion and let the reader decide for themselves whether to try your restaurant."
"Waste of money!!!!Came here tonight because my wife was at The hospital down the road and this was her last meal since she couldn't eat anything past midnight and ordered King Pao Chicken. We got the dinner daily special since we didn't want a ton of food and that was a mistake. Size wise, it's a lot of food. However what is actually put in the meal is a joke. Tons and I mean tons of bamboo shoots, (I actually filled my second opening in the togo box full of them and still had some) lots of peanuts, peas, and minced thigh chicken meat. I threw my food away after I gave up trying to take a bite of food without bamboo shoots. Never coming back. So sad too as I am only 15 minutes away normally."
"We made a reservation and arrived well before our reservation time. We still had to wait 20 mins after our reservation time to be seated. What's the point in making a reservation?Decor: 3.5/5-Looks like it use to be a Pizza Hut inside? -The red booth seats look comfy however we sat at the round table which can comfortably seat 6 without obstructing traffic. The round tables can seat up to 10, maybe more. Service: 4/5Food: 4/5-The begger's chicken was unique and came in a huge loaf of bread. The chicken was moist and tender yet nothing to brag about. This was about $37.-Peking duck was roughly $25 each and more worth it than the beggar's chicken-Calamari app is a must however it is slightly on the salty side-Singaporean rice noodles were standard, nothing to brag about-Combination Fried Rice was great. Wish I had gotten two orders of that. Will be returning for the sizzling shrimp and scallop dish"
"Food - 3Service - 4Value - 3I feel like the last couple of times I've come here that the food just isn't as good as it used to be and the prices feel like they keep going up too.  The Peking duck seemed dry the last two times and the Beggar's Chicken also seemed a tad try the last two times as well.  Because this place is so popular, it can also get quite crowded on the weekend for dinner and then you end up with some fairly cramped quarters from time to time."
"Great and affordable place to come for some Peking duck - just remember to call ahead to order the duck. The duck is juicy with nice crispy skin,.  We get the stir fry duck bones, which are a pain to eat but tasty and you can't go wrong with the pancakes.  However some of the sides are a little weak.  Th sauteed egg plant came swimming in sauce which we didn't appreciate.  Next time I want to try the begger's chicken but you need to order a couple of days in advance."
"We had 2 roasted duck, mango shrimp, and Beijing beef. Each of the ducks leftover bones were used as a stir fry dish & duck soup. The duck was really flavorful but I wish the duck skin was crispier. The mango shrimp was weird, it all just tasted like seafood (that nasty seafood taste) & the shrimp was soft in batter. As for the Beijing beef, it was really good!! I liked the duck soup because it was really hearty with all the herbs but the duck stir fry just made the duck kinda dry. Overall the duck is really good & fresh! The server was really friendly."
"We made reservation around 4pm on Saturday and was ecstatic they can accommodate us with a 7:30 reservation. The restaurant is not very big and the decor is dated but it gives you a warm family feel. I did a lot of yelping and asking around so I knew exactly what we were going to get. We went with the Peking Duck with the stir fry, Crispy Red Snapper, Combination Fried Rice, Parmesan Prawn, and Water Spinach with Beef. The Peking Duck was exceptional, everyone at the table loved it. The guy who cut our duck was welcoming and talkative which made the whole experience even better. The only critique I would have is that the water spinach and beef was a little salty and had an overwhelming taste of oyster sauce. However, everything else was great. I would definitely recommend Mr.Wok to my friends and family.  Important: You must make reservation if you don't want to wait or get turned away and do not skip out on the Peking Duck!!!!"
"This place is amazing. I like the Peking duck, the chicken, and the sweet and sour fish. They do need reservation and advance notice for the duck/special chicken."
"Primarily came for the Peking duck! You must call in and order in advance. The Peking duck comes with the buns, veggies, and hoisin sauce. You can always order more buns if needed too. There's also a choice of roti/pancake instead of buns. The meat is really tender and fresh. The skin is perfectly crispy. There's a person that serves you the duck and slices the meats for your at your table. At the end of your dinner you get a choice between two different soups. The one we had was really light. It was a good balance with all the food we had.Orange chicken and crispy tango beef are my other two favorite meat side dishes. If you're a fan of the mayo mango shrimp, I wouldn't suggest getting it here. It's not my favorite. There's a lot of mango versus shrimp. It's BYOB as well!I went with about 8 people. We got two Peking duck orders and 9 different plates. Splitting it evenly between everyone it was about $23 give or take. It's well worth it! You definitely leave the restaurant with a food coma."
"Once again had an incredible meal there!!!  The sizzling seafood skillet is fantastic. All3 of us enjoyed our entrees. Also, out server Allison was the best ever. Friendly, cheerful and playful. She made sure to not put our entrees in to be cooked until 5 or 10 minutes after our appetizers arrived. A rare thing. Highly recommended to be sure!!!"
"Best Peking Duck in Dallas, hands down.Everything I've tried here is good but honestly, the Peking Duck just steals the show.  They bring out the roasted duck whole and slice it up table-side.  I think it may have been the owner who brought out our duck and he was so nice, taking the time to explain how they're able to get the skin so incredibly crispy while keeping the meat tender and juicy.  The dish comes with either pancakes or steamed buns (my preference).  Grab one of those piping hot buns and layer in some amazing duck meat, crispy skin, hoisin sauce, and scallions, and you've got the most amazing bite ever. Bonus!  They'll take the bones and leftover meat and make you a second (very large) duck dish-- either a stir fry or soup.  Can't beat that!"
"Absolutely ridiculous!! We just got our order dropped off. Waited a few hours, ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Almond Chicken, wontons, and chicken chow mein. dishes....and some have NO CHICKEN! To top it off we got TWO chicken less Kung Pao dishes, and not our Almond Chicken!! They literally are full of disgusting water chestnuts and peanuts! Not one piece of chicken! Only the chow mein had chicken and the wontons are the only thing not messed up... We're beyond livid with this and cannot believe someone thought this was acceptable to send out. We ordered through a delivery service, and the place is now closed so there's nothing we can do at this time. I really urge someone to be held accountable for this cause I have never in my life ran into something this bad. We don't even understand how this place has so many stars?!?"
"Sometimes they're on and others...I've experienced the best fried rice and will go back a month or so later and the rice is hard, they're out of eggs, or the ribs are hard and tough as heck! Not sure what the inconsistency is about but..."
"If you are ever in the mood for pei king duck, this is the place you need to go, and FYI you need to order the duck in advance before you go.I went to dinner here with 3 friends and we got 1 duck and 3 side dishes which was more then enough food. We ordered water spinach, salt and pepper shrimp, and tofu family style with pork. With the duck the server cuts it right in front of you and it comes with buns and sauce to wrap the duck with. The duck bones and remaining meat can either be used for a soup or stir fry- we chose stir fry. The duck was so delicious, it's very hard to get duck so juicy and flavorful but this place did it, I was so impressed with the duck. Everything else their was subpar, but the duck is a must! The stir fry duck was a little salty and everything else was over cooked. The tofu with pork was good, but again on the saltier side. Everything comes with rice though! The service here is so unstaffed. They were so busy even on a Thursday night that it took a long time to get anything we asked for, even our check."
Eggplant stir fried added shredded pork and fried tofu EXCELLENTBeggar's Chicken just okPeking duck just ok. Mango shrimp surprisingly goodRed snapper fried excellentRed snapper steamed excellentPot stickers just ok Bok choy shitake mushroom very goodGreen beans fried with tofu very good Shrimp fried rice very goodService here always goodFried donuts with banana fillings good
"The other reviews and late dinner with some close friends led to high expectations.One thing that's kinda cool is this place is an old converted Pizza Hut - you know the actual restaurant where going as a kid to get pizza with the family was an experience. Anyway, rose-tinted memories of mediocre pizza are now replaced with quite excellent Chinese food with the always appreciated BYOB option.I got the wonton soup as a starter which had great broth and good wontons. Not a bad start. For my main course I went with the Szechwan Chicken. It was pretty tasty but I'll be honest I was a bit disappointed as I expected more. I couldn't tell if they used real Szechwan Peppercorn which is supposed to numb your tongue a bit - first time trying it. There was too much sauce where I prefer a drier style.Still, my business dinner companions enjoyed their meal and they live close by so this is still a great option in Eastern Plano / North Dallas."
"Oh man, one of our new favorites --- for the entire family. It's certainly an eating experience ordering the peking duck. It's as authentic as you can get here in the states. It feels like a hole-in-the-wall place when you drive up and even when you're inside, but that's what makes the atmosphere so great. Mr. Wok has been recognized time and time again in Dallas, and there's many reasons behind that. Every dish we've had has been amazing - full of flavor and delicious. Keep in mind that the restaurant is small - reservations are preferred with a large enough party, parking is limited, and it's a converted Pizza Hut building or something like that. If you know this information and visit for the atmosphere, food, and service, and not judge by appearance, it's a 5-star dining experience"
Best Peking duck in the DFW and much cheaper. The restaurant is always packed so call in advance.
"Pleasant spot, nice staff not expensiveDuck at dinner may be the treat  described belowbut lunch was sugary gloppy '60's american/cantonesethat I can better from the freezer at Kroger's"
"This place is amazing I'm new in town and found this place, the food is fantastic juicy freshly cooked and the service was great. I'm for sure coming here everyday!"
"I've lived in Dallas for a little over 10 years and always chose Thai or Vietnamese over Chinese since my Chinese restaurant experiences had been ho-hum at best. Until today. This place is small (in a former Pizza Hut) with 12 tables. Had the appetizer sampler which found us saying Wow, oooo, try this one. Got the Crispy Tangy Beef with fried rice and it was the Japanese shorter grain rice with a good chew and flavor. Beef was tender, green beans were fresh and crisp. We saw 2 tables get the beautiful Peking duck and a table get the Beggar's Chicken. The carver/waiter offered the mallet to one of the diners who whacked the bread dome over and over with no success. I clapped and cheered him on and the rest of the diners joined in - success! We will be back. Loved it!"
"This was our first time at Mr. Wok and it was a great dining experience.  We ordered the Peking duck and it was fantastic!  With table side carving, the duck was tender, had very little fat, and the skin was so crispy.  Our waitress was very nice and recommended we use the bones for stir fry and soup.  I loved the stir fry, the mustard green was crunchy and always one of my favorite ingredients in any dish.  The soup needed some flavoring, if you add a little salt, it's great and a nice ending to any meal.  Service was excellent."
"There are two places in DFW I would order peking duck from: Mr. Wok and Beijing Brothers in Coppell. Mr. Wok has been around longer, but I did not try their duck until recently. Their meat was not gamey when freshly carved and served. However, the stir fry (made with leftover meat) did taste gamey... but it could just be me, as I am very sensitive. I recommend calling ahead to pre-order, since they are known for this dish and sell out quickly. I also tried their whole fried fish, and loved it. It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce poured over the fish was sweet and tangy. Overall, this is a good place for a casual family dinner. It looks pretty run-down, so it's not the most ideal place for a date or a girls' night out. Prices are a little higher than other Chinese restaurants but still reasonable, considering most of their dishes are shareable. Service can be hit or miss, depending on how busy they are."
"Went here based on the reviews.  I've been several times and all visits have been great to good to fair - seemingly in that order - so I don't know if I should go back!  Crab rangoons are big!  The last time I ordered lunch to go, the rice was crunchy, which kind of ruined my sesame chicken.  I will probably give them another chance, but it may be a while."
"Hands down one of the top 3 Chinese places I have been to.  Please you must try Mr Wok if you haven't before.First off, the fact that traditional Chinese families (think 3-4 generations all together) come here for dinners validate this place is legit.  Top that off with a team of servers who have been here (and know the menu well) a while, you can trust their recommendations.  Also VERY affordable!! Food - cha Han fried rice is legit. The duck is a MUST get. Crispy beef is also very good. The egg foo young, basil noodles, sesame chicken, orange chicken, mango shrimp are all....good but not great. Can't wait to try the other dishes.Parking can be tough, this is BYOB so keeps your bill down! Heard ""meh"" reviews with Beggar Chicken.Please if you're considering this place, do your taste buds a favor and just come!"
"Modern take on classic Chinese dishes,Mr. Wok does not disappoint. FromThe Beijing Duck that is carved and served in a wonton to a crispy beef that melts in your mouth, this quaint location needs a reservation on weekends. They have several speciality dishes and we try a different one each time we go. If the wait is too long, order take out. It travels well."
"The peking duck experience here was awesome. They carve the duck at your table and will explain on how they made the duck. On top of that, the duck was tasty which just completes the experience. I would totally recommend on taking a date here especially if they never had peking duck before. But be sure to call ahead of time to make sure they have ducks though since they're made in a limited quantity."
"Love this place and eat there ever so often. The Peking duck is wonderful and some of our party has had it in Beijing. The food has always been often but last night our waiter sucked. We got appetizer plates and for 3 adults he brought out 2 dinner plates. WTF was I supposed to use? The little ap plate evidently. He never came back to refill water. We had to flag him down after 10 mins looking for him. We have never had him before. Hope we never have him again. We have had the beautiful red headed woman and another man and always been pleased but this guy was terribleThe guy was a tall, med brown haired white guy about mid 20 s, with glasses"
"I'm from CA and when I'm in town visiting family I have to order thePeking duck.  I can eat the buns that come with the order alone it's fluffy, airy, semi sweetened.  The duck skin is crispy and holds a lot of flavor."
"This place is great. You should order the duck a day early to assure you get one.  It is byob but that just makes it really inexpensive.  The duck comes with pancakes (like tortillas), scallions, and plum sauce.  The extra bones are made into either a stir fry or soup.  We've gotten the stir fry both times.  We had lots of leftovers both times.  The service is great and they are really nice.  The only reason for a missing star is because the table covers are stained and it makes it seem dirty, but it was not.  Some cloth table covers would really dress up the place instead of the hard plastic stained ones.  We will definitely be back again for the best duck ever!"
"Get the duck! It needs to be ordered in advance just like the Beggar's Chicken. I went with a group of friends and we ordered ahead for both which would have been plenty for all six of us but we decided to also try the Orange Peel Beef, Chicken Chow Fun, and Bok Choy. Everything was amazing but the duck was probably my favorite. They bring out the whole duck and the server cuts it up and serves the meat and crispy skin on a platter along with wraps, veggies and hoisin sauce for part 1. For part 2, they use the rest of the duck and prepare it either in a soup or stir fry based on your preference. We did the stir fry and it was delicious - lots of garlic. The chicken dish is quite a show and the meat comes out very moist since they roast it for 22 hours within the bread, banana and lotus leaves, and aluminum foil. Friendly service too! We'll definitely go back."
"Small restaurant on 14th street. They're well known for their Peking duck, which I was hoping to try.Unfortunately, since this was a spur of the moment thing, I didn't pre-order one and was just hoping to get one of their extra ones they sell first-come-first-serve.Well, unfortunately not....Fortunately their other food turns out to be pretty good as well.We tried their Cantonese crispy noodles, puffed shrimp, mango shrimp and pot stickers.The Cantonese crispy noodles are not like the birds nest noodles at most Chinese restaurants, but almost as thick as spaghetti and, for a lack of a better word, a fluffy crispy. Very interesting and also very tasty. It came with a dark sauce, veggies and your choice of a protein. The sauce was pretty mild (I usually prefer spicier fare), but still tasted good.The pot stickers were delicious, filled with cabbage and pork, with a nice bite.The puffed shrimp was shrimp bis in a puffed up dough, also very good.The mango shrimp comes in a bowl made with wonton dough and filled with cold mange, a sweet sauce and crispy fried shrimp on top. Not bad, but a little sweet for my taste.Overall a very good meal and I'll definitely come back, and this this time I'll call-ahead for a duck. Oh, and it's a pretty small place, so you may wait a little to be seated during rush times."
"Friendly staff but the food was awful! I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce, which came out as a clumpy mess. The steamed rice was overcooked. The pork egg roll was cold on the inside so it was probably just reheated. I had high hopes based on previous reviews but I won't be back."
Attentive service.All of the quality of food was exceptional as was the presentation. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal. This place is consistent and we will return again soon.Adjacent table ordered several Peking ducks. They were carved at the table and the experience looked incredible.
"Jack,Don't get me wrong, your place do have good peking duck and have been there a few times.I call at 1 pm but all your server say was no table that fits 15 people and never said anything about tables were being reserve nor anything else then hung up. That's what made me upset, which if you were in my shoes would be too. Also the person who call back was my bro, so that can get an answer from another person."
One of my all time favorite places for the last 13 years! We love Jack the owner also! Do yourself a favor and eat here!
The peking duck was fantastic! One duck is enough to serve 4 people .  You can serve the rest of the duck two ways. I prefer stir fry instead of soup. Other things were pretty good too.  I testify that they serve authentic Chinese food!Be sure to make a reservation on weeknights. You'll need to reserve a duck when make the reservation. Just try everything!
"This was a very nice experience.  A busy place.  Food was great.  Portions are large enough to share.  There were 2 of us.  Had an appetizer and one meal and still had leftovers.  They do have a lazy Susan in the middle of 4 large table to serve family style.  Those table seat 10 comfortably.  Nice staff.  There specialty is Duck.  This is something you have to call and make sure they have, if not you can order it.  Large groups are best to make reservations.  Will definitely go again."
"Still going strong and still the best Peking duck in Texas. Service was great. Erick was our waiter and he was on the ball throughout the night. The owner Jack made recommendation for dishes in addition to the duck, which is the way to go if you are a large group."
Peking Duck was amazing. Crispy skin.  Great flavor. Mango shrimp was just okay. Not enough shrimp. Too sweet for my palate. Will definitely return.
"Since we took it to go, this review is solely on the food and the taste. Effing delicious. Crispy skin, juicy meat. No need to explain. Reserve yours now and try it!"
Yum yum and yum.  I've been here twice now.  Reservations definitely required.  Food is amazing.  Everything was scrumptious.
This place was highly recommended for their Orange Chicken. When we were seated we noticed how greasy dirty the fans were and tablecloth was stained. We ordered Mongolian Beef and received a plate of mainly sliced onions and beef pieces so small you couldn't pick it up with a fork. Not much heat or flavor either. The Orange Chicken was tough and tasted like it had been cooked some time before we ordered it and sauce added and reheated. We should have sent it back but the less than $20 tab wasn't worth it. Will probably not return.
"When we drove up to this place, we saw a tiny lil building with a parking lot full of cars. Who would've thought that such amazing food would be here?? We ordered the peking duck, beggars chicken and fried red snapper. The duck needs to be ordered 1 day in advance, while the chicken needs to be ordered 2 days in advance so keep that in mind if you plan on coming here. The first thing we got was the duck, which came whole as the carver delicately slices off thin layers of the crispy skin and the tender meat underneath. We had our duck with the steamed buns, hoisin sauce and green onions. The skin was so flavorful and crispy. The meat was soft and meaty. Totally delicious. This has got to be one of the best peking ducks I've ever had ! After carving the duck, he asked if we wanted it stir fried or cooked in a soup. We selected the stir fry option and we were so happy with our choice. The duck came out crispy and sooo flavorful! It was stir fried with onions and these pickled veggies. It was amazing! Next came the beggar's chicken, which was served in this giant hard bread and the waiter asked if anyone wants to try to crack it open. Inside it was a foil wrapped whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice. The upper portion of the chicken was quite bland and dry but as you dig deeper, you'll find the juices that give it a good bit of flavor. The flavor was  a bit too herby for us so we weren't too crazy about this dish, it was cool for the experience though.Lastly, we had the fried red snapper. Wow, this dish was beautiful! It was a huge, meaty fish that had this meat sauce poured over it. Can't quite describe the sauce but it was yummy! The fish was crispy and flavorful and surprisingly, this was only $25 for an extra large! (although I'm not sure if we're just really hungry but the XL wasn't that big as we ate the whole thing between 4 people)Overall, we had a wonderful experience coming here. The food was great and I would recommend the duck & the snapper to anybody. I wouldn't go back for the chicken but it is a good filler if you are trying to feed more people."
"I've been here twice and each time I was disappointed. The food is mediocre at best.Peking duck w/buns: The duck is dry and bland. The buns were stuck together and would rip apart. The hoisin sauce is hoisin sauce, always good. As you are being served the duck you are told that it is a high quality lean duck. All I'm saying is I don't care if it is an organic, fair trade, humane certified full beaked pond roaming lean duck that gets daily massages - if you dry it out you've ruined it. Lean ducks should still be juicy and rich when made properly.Broccoli beef: I didn't enjoy it and don't recommend it."
"Not bad but not the greatest Chinese food I had. This place is tiny so expect a wait if you want to eat in. If not, you're better off getting take out. Service here isn't very attentive but it's doable. I see they're trying their best. The food has been inconsistent between the two times we visited. On our first visit, food was great. But this second time, most of of food came out cold or not up to par like our first time. Shrimp fried rice came out cold and the crispy beef had too much sauce. The first time we ordered the fried snapper and that was great. But if you don't want to pick at the bones the thai sole is delicious and comes without bones. Haven't had the chance to try the peking duck but it looks great. I'll probably be back again but I'm still on the lookout for a more authentic Chinese place."
"This is the second time I've been here and it just gets better!  The restaurant is pretty small and they have a small staff so there is normally a bit of waiting involved.  That kind of thing rarely bothers me so I don't think it's a big deal but I know some people might get annoyed.  I came in a party of 6 and we all shared the appetizers of dumplings (delicious, fresh, and hot) and lettuce wraps.  We also got the Peking Duck and Beggar's Chicken (both of which you need to reserve 24 hours in advance due to the way they cook it).  The Peking duck is carved table side and the skin is crispy, the meat is juicy and it is absolutely amazing.  It comes with very thin pancakes/tortillas to wrap the duck in with hoisin sauce and onions.  Then you get the choice of what you would like them to do with the rest of the meat still on the bone (stir fry or soup).  We've gotten the stir fry both times and it is amazing in its own!  Just the duck can feed two people.  The Beggar's Chicken comes encased in a bread bowl that they crack open at your table (they'll even let you do it if you want to)!  The chicken inside is wrapped in foil and bamboo leaves so it will cook and seal in all the juices with the sticky rice.  The chicken is SO tender you scoop it out with a spoon!  Overall it is by far 5 stars!  I can't wait to come again, maybe during lunch since their lunch prices look really good!"
"Mr. Wok, I would like to personally thank you for letting me make a fool of myself in front of the entire restaurant while I was trying to crack open the bread for the beggars chicken we ordered. I then watched you with your fancy shears cut open the bread to reveal a beautiful bird wrapped in leaves. The chicken was ridiculously tender and the sticky rice filling was amazing. The chicken was huge and we ended up taking it to go and it was 2 containers worth (not filled all the way). My dad (Chinese food connoisseur) was pleased with the way it tasted, the last time he had it was in China and he hasn't been able to find a place that served it. We also ordered the Peking duck which was delicious, I personally like getting the buns over the pancakes. The pancakes are fine but I don't like how hard they are to peel apart and its just one big lump of pancake. For our second duck course we got the soup this time which was really great considering we ate soo much food, it was light and flavorful. It had some noodles and some cabbage added to the broth. The stir fry is a little more filling and messy but there is more flavor. We also ordered some eggplant in garlic sauce and man that was really good, it wasn't what I was expecting. I was thinking it'll be some garlic on eggplant but it was a deep and dark flavorful garlicky sauce, it is totally worth trying. We also ordered fried calamari and pot stickers. The pot stickers were the typical frozen to pan, nothing special; not worth ordering. The calamari was fried perfectly and had an intense but not too strong garlic flavor. We came here on a Wednesday night and every table was taken (thankfully we had a reservation). Ducks were flying out of the kitchen every 10 minutes, I think I saw at least 15 ducks being served while I was there, this place is obviously known for their peking ducks. The service was fine and it was an overall great experience, I highly recommend this restaurant!"
I wish this place was much closer to me in Ft Worth !  The Peking duck is unbelievable and you get a second course with the duck whether it's stir fry or soup. I've been here twice and literally everybody gets a duck!  Definitely call in advance to make sure you have a duck that day! I would recommend giving a call 24 hours in advance!
"I love this place, they make the best Peking duck I've had in Texas. They bring it table-side and carve it right next to your table. The skin is crispy. The meat is juicy and tender. It's exactly how a duck should be made. They also make a second dish out of the bones, either a stir fry or a soup. The stir fry option is a bit too heavy for me after eating all of the duck meat from the first dish so I prefer the soup option.The only other thing I've had here is their corn and crap soup which is also really delicious.They are very popular so expect a wait if you come during peak hours. If you know you want duck, be sure to reserve one ahead of time since they sometimes run out if you come late."
Best Peking duck in town. Small cozy place. Our favorite is the Peking duck with buns but make sure to make your reservation a day in advance or no duck for you. Also they only serve it on weekends. Another great dish is beggar's chicken.
"I tried this Resturant base on all the good reviews on Yelp. They must have paid Yelp to filter all the bad reviews. 4 stars?... Are  you kidding, I was very disappointed in the food. We ordered the Peking duck and it was terrible, the skin had a thick layer of fat on it, the ideal Peking duck is not suppose to have fat on the skin, it suppose to be roast and bake until all fat are melted and leave a crunchy skin. The schuwan beef is a joke, the beef was chop up so small like it was ground beef with over 75% of onion, a good thing I love onions. I had to give the credit on the chow fun, it was decent, but still not good. If this Resturant was in china town the wouldn't last more than a month. Nothing special, I will never come back."
Best Peking duck in Dallas! Service is awesome.. However this place does get packed.. I would suggest calling previous to going to see wait times...
"I haven't found any other place with good peking duck in Dallas yet, and the duck is always pretty good here.  Be sure to pre-order it at least a day or two in advance, since it takes some time to prepare.  All of the other dishes I've tried here have been authentic and tasty, as well.  Come with a group if you'd like to eat family-style and try more dishes.  I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu items!"
My star rating is all about the food and service.  This is a very casual joint in Plano that by the looks of things must be housed in an old pizza Hut. Packed in a random week night we were glad we made reservations.  If you want the Peking duck (and why wouldn't you! ?) Pre order this 24 hours in advance. .. the beggers chicken is 48 hours I think. We went for the duck and having had peking duck before at a top Beijing restaurant I wasn't expecting to be wowed.  But wowed I was.  They carve the little quacker table side and the pieces of duck skin with a thin layer of fat just melt in your mouth. They use most parts of the duck so you get to choose a fried rice duck dish with some parts or a soup with the bones. .. or you can ask for some of each. Everything was delicious. Some of the side dishes are well worth ordering too.  The eggplant dish was just phenomenal. If you want Peking duck I haven't found anywhere better in dfw (please message me if you have an alternative! )This is legit!
Love this place. Great service.  Duck carved at the table is fabulous. Roasted perfectly.All sides are good. Price is right.Limited parking however.Try it!  BYOB
"I was really looking to this place after reading other yelper's reviews. I ordered the pot stickers as an app, and they were worse than the Mr. Panda ones I get at Costco. Too soggy, without that ever-so-slight crisp I really enjoy. The sauce was not quite sweet enough for my liking either. I ordered the Szechuan (sp?) chicken for the main course, and was once again let down. Very little chicken to vegetable ratio, and they use white meat, which tends to be too dry in many Asian dishes (IMHO). The service was good, and the BYOB aspect is always cool. I'm keeping it at two stars, because the price was reasonable, and maybe I didn't find ""the right dish"". A couple next to me ordered the roasted duck (carved tableside, I might add), and it looked delicious. I'd be willing to check it out again, but not after I try the 50,000 other restaurants in the greater DFW area."
"Very small restaurant. Nice servers.  We came at 7:30. Got seat in 15mins.  Got the LAST duck (2 styles)! Yay!!! And it was only by chance because someone canceled their order.   Great crispy lean duck!! Yes! We picks the buns and it came out with enough Hoisin sauce and shredded green onions for the table! The only thing I can complain about the duck is it wasn't marinated in anything.  So without the hoisin sauce, there was no other flavor.  Our second style was sautéed, which did come out very flavorful! We heard the soup is kind of bland.  Sesame chicken... It was okay.  Lighter sweet flavor, a little different than what you are used to.  The chicken is very thin cut and a lot of breading to it. I don't think we would get this again. Whole tilapia - we didn't try it because the sauce it was doused in did not look appetizing.  Halfway to a very thick soup consistency. Our group was not impressed with it though saying the fish did not taste fresh and overcooked.   I would come back for the duck and the beggars chicken at another table looked very interesting."
"This place is wonderful. My father and I frequent here often. Food is always delicious and the staff is very attentive. Down side is, being the location is rather small, in the evening the wait time can be long and the place becomes rather noisy.Food: Amazing. A++Atmosphere: Decent. Can become noisy when crowded.Service: Wonderful.I will definitely continue eating here and highly recommend others to try it out."
"Peking Duck is superb - great service on a busy, busy Saturday night - we love our regular dishes: mango shrimp and water spinach - yum - depending on the friends we bring along, we order more dishes with their tastes in mind - it's also BYOB here - love Mr. Wok!!!"
"The Peking Duck is carved in front of you, which is interesting. You would think these presentations will only be offered in higher class restaurants. As for the taste itself, it was pretty good, but I still prefer Peking Duck at MyCanh. What I like most about the Peking duck here is that they offer you a choice - if you want to wrap your protein in the bun (which is what I prefer) or the mushu wrap (much like a tortilla wrap). I'll probably come back once in a while, but I'll head to MyCanh for the periodic Peking duck cravings."
"Fantastic food and great service every time! We love this place! Plus, BYOB doesn't hurt!"
"Oh, Mr. Wok.  Oh, how I love you!  It had been quite some time before I had ventured back to reestablish this relationship.  It was Chinese New Year celebration week and on 2/21, I'd organized a group of friends to come try it.  It was the continuation of a beautiful friendship.I had done my duty, ordering the Peking duck 24 hours in advance.  I alerted my friends to the BYOB charm of the place.  We arrived at noon, our table having been reserved by Jack himself!  It was so crowded too and I was happy that my friends who arrived early were able to be seated.  The place is small and crowded due to the festivities.  We were able to savor our drinks, ordered appetizers to keep us busy and then enjoyed watching the two, huge beggar's chicken being rolled out to be smashed in by the guests who ordered them!  That looked fun.  A giant dish, with a puffy crust of bread was punched into by the mallets they give you with the meal.  Inside, a chicken that is stuffed with sticky rice and mushrooms, wrapped in foil to make it extra juicy and tender.  Oh, that is definitely on my list for next time!We ordered the wok seared edamame, which has a great flavor.  The crispy tofu that everyone tried- so fluffy and delicious paired with peanut sauce.  Vegetable fried rice that came with bean sprouts, vegetable chow fun noodles and a couple of appetizer samples- which had some fried stuff.  The steamed dumplings were delicious.  That kept us occupied until the duck arrived with Jack set to carve it like a master!  Oh, snap.  I am pretty sure I gave a brief set of instructions to the new acolytes!  First the bun, then hoisin, then duck, duck skin & scallions.  Roll that up and eat!  The carcass still had meat on it and we ordered that stir fried.  As the plate of duck was placed in the middle of the table, everyone dug in.  It became a race to see which of my duck loving friends could keep pace with me.  As everyone slowed down and I started in on my 4th roll up, I could tell my party was fat and happy!  We walked away with leftover Peking duck stir fry, fried rice and noodles.  For my party of 8, the tab came out to $17.xx and for the culinary feast we enjoyed, that is well worth it.  Somehow, I ended up with the leftovers in my fridge.  No worries, friends, they're all gone now- and yes, I shared with a couple of other friends!  All of it was so good and such a rare treat!  Until next time, Mr. Wok, I'll be dreaming of that delicious, buttery duck skin- and planning my next attack!"
"Food (***** out of *****); This is the best Peking Duck in Dallas. Unless you want to fly to China, you will not find a better Peking Duck. The skin is crispy, the fat underneath is soft and warm, and the meat is juicy. Yum! The duck could be seasoned with herbs and salted just a tad more, but that's just a minor nit pick. Their other dishes are good to ok, but the duck is stellar! I normally just order the duck. It's a big bird so if you're just 2 people dining, there's enough food in the duck dish to feed 2 people for several meals (take some home). The duck comes with Chinese tortillas or bread buns, green onions, sauce, and after you're done, they can use the bones to stir fry it or cook a soup with them. Their fried fish is good. Everything else is just ok. Ambience (** out of *****); Restroom is not very clean, but to be fair, it not disgusting, either. They really should put some of those blue disinfecting balls in the bowl and have some air fresheners in there. The restaurant is very tiny. However, you cannot fault someone's restaurant for being tiny, because it costs MONEY to pay rent. What most reviewers don't know is that on weeknights when business is slow, they still have to pay rent.Service (**** out of *****); Good service. The waiters had good teamwork. You can ask any of the waiters for assistance and nobody will turn you down because, ""it's not my table."" (I just hate that)Conclusion; Although the tally is 4 stars, I gave them an extra star due to superior value. The restaurant is BYOB so you're free to bring your own alcoholic drinks. I love Peking Duck with Tsingtao beer. Ain't nothin' better. It's a great deal. For $35 (not including tax and tips), you get enough food to feed two peeps for 2 to 3 meals. Yay!"
"Went here twice in two consecutive days. The first night, after coming on my friends request (she said she was craving peanut butter chicken. I shrugged it off as a white person thing), we arrived at 8, and their business was booming. We had to wait at the front for 10 awkward minutes before one of the 2 waiters even looked at us. They had an extensive menu, and my first thought was, how can they possibly cook so many things well?! They don't. I ordered the Sizzling Seafood Platter, which was absolutely disgusting. But my friends PB Chicken was to die for.  Second visit was with my bf. The crab porridge appetizer was tasty! We ordered the pecking duck, which is a 5 star over and over again. It honestly reminds me of the Beijing duck I eat back in my home country. The skilled waiters carve he duck in front of you! (If you order their bread chicken, they put on yet another good show!) The skin is so crispy, don't hesitate to add it in your wrap; the put it on the side, but it's not just garnish! For the second course that comes with this order, we had the stirfry option and it was very flavorful (duck soup isn't good). They didn't waste part of this animal, just like we do it in China! The patrons all seems very happy. But what I suggest for first timers, just order their most popular specials to be safe."
"Fantastic!! Three Peking Ducks, plenty of appetizers, and great laughs with friends. With the duck leftovers we did two bones and a soup! Both were amazing! Mr. Wok, where the lazy Susan turns into the roulette of death when you over order!"
"Great food and great service!! Though it's very busy, our server, Allison, took great care of us. We ordered the salt n pepper calamari, potstickers, Bok choy n shiitake mushroom, and the famous Peking duck (remember to preorder this or else they won't have one for you). The bill come up to about $60, so cheap!! It was a pleasant surprise lol. All four of us were very full. This restaurant is small and intimate. Definitely recommend to reserve before going because it's small and they get packed pretty quick. They don't care about food presentation at all (hence its not really picture worthy). However, the flavoring really made up for it (isn't that what food is really about anyway?). The dishes were presented in their simplest form. As for the main dish (which is the Peking duck) is one of the best I've ever tasted. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. They carve it right in front of you. Will definitely be back again.Merry Christmas everyone!"
"My family and I have been coming here for ten years and the food is consistently good every time. The Szechuan beef is excellent and the dish has tons of flavor without being too oily/greasy. Yummy food at a great price, they do get very busy so consider getting your food to go if you're in a hurry. Love this place"
Absolutely amazing food. We have the Peking duck in the Beggars chicken and it was outstanding. I'd recommend this place to anybody and we've eaten everywhere.
"I'm going to visit Mr Wok again this Friday for Birthday party.  This place is a GEM.  Best Authentic Peking Duck plate ever and it tastes heavenly.  Reservation is mandatory for ordering Peking duck because they roast it over night.  Place is pretty small so it gets really crowded fast.  I think after 7 pm during weekend, good luck finding a table if you don't make reservation.  Peking duck is about $35 and most people trying to get a table, order this to make sure they have a reserved seating.a master carver demonstrates carving a whole peking duck infront of you, that was a treat!  tastes so good!BYOB so you can bring your six packs or a wine if you preferhope you enjoy like we did and we will again"
"I really enjoyed our sit down experience. Normally I do pick up, but my husband wanted to go with me. Upon walking in, he commented how cozy it felt. We decided to eat there. Immediately were seated and had great service the whole time thanks to Allison! This place is BYOB. Awesome! Will remember for next time. The food was delicious. Mr. Wok came to check on us and it felt welcoming! We recommend this place for sure!"
Make the reservation a day ahead for the Peking duck. Amazing table presentation of the duck. Get the steamed buns to enjoy that crispy duck skin!!Not sure what the soup after presentation is like but the stir-fry with the duck bones and remaining meat was so flavorful. The pot stickers are so good that I could have eaten a plate full. So full and no regrets!
"I love Mr. Wok's Peking Duck. The skin is crispy and melts in your mouth. The meat part is tender and juicy - all without ducky smell, while keeping the flavor within. I had the duck to-go several times because of this, and have enjoyed them at home and friends' places. With that said, the service we had on the last time we visited (dine-in) was unpleasant. We had a reservation for 7:30 to serve my mentor's family and his mother who was visiting. The party arrived at 7:10 - with 4 kids all under age of 6 - as the weather was bad and we did not want to risk of being late. (If arrived late more than 15 minutes, then the restaurant reserves right to give up the table.)  We let them know we have arrived, who acknowledged  the reservation for 7:30. The people who were sitting at the table where we were assigned to were finished eating and already had their leftovers to-go, but they were sitting there until 7:32 - which was fine. Even after the table was cleaned, we were not able to sit for another 15 minutes. After we sat down, our appetizer did not come out for another 15 minutes. For 7:30 reservation, our meal started 35 minutes late. As I arrived, I asked if the meal could be ready at 7:30, as the kids are hungry, which they replied ""yes"". But that was not kept. Another thing was carving. I read so much of how nice to see duck carvings on the table side. As I had the ducks to-go before, I was really excited for this experience. Our first duck was carved behind us, which practically no one was able to watch without bending or twisting. I showed the lady a nice spot with no traffic and plenty of space, on the table, but she refused. She came to the empty spot for the second duck, thankfully, the party was able to see the carving and take pictures. The ducks were luke-warm, and soon turned cold. Asking for straws, fork, and/or napkins? Good luck, b/c it took us multiple requests and a long wait to get them on the table. I was really embarrased to treat my mentor and his family at this restaurant with the long wait, multiple requests on utensils, and luke-warm food. I still tip them plenty for the food, but not sure if I would visit the place again with the service I have experienced."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Dallas/Fort Worth! I highly recommend ordering their Salt & Pepper Calamari and their Peking Duck! It is best to call in and make a reservation for the Peking Duck to ensure availability, since it is a hot commodity. Their Peking Duck, complete with either buns or pancakes of your choosing, is absolutely amazing. I especially love it since it is very reminiscent of my childhood. They bring it out to you freshly cooked and slice up the juicy and tender meat right in front of you! The service is also impeccable here. The entire staff and owners are friendly, sweet and highly accommodating! If you haven't tried Mr. Wok, you are really missing out!"
First time to eat here. It's very good Chinese food try the orange chicken it's very tasty
"This place has some of the best Chinese food I have been coming her for 18 yrs the owner jack knows my whole family, they are byob and make u feel like family love this place"
I love Mr. Wok! I just come here for takeout for lunch or dinner but ever ytime I get something I am always satisfied and glad I came.  Their lunch menu is inexpensive and extensive.  They have traditional Chinese food that has all the great flavor and authenticity of a real Chinese kitchen---no mall food court bland food here.  I recommend the Mongolian beef or any of the shrimp dishes.  So glad this place is close to work!
"Truly amazing Peking duck and crispy fried whole snapper. The Peking duck is huge and juicy. Also, the chef pumps air between the skin and meat of the duck before roasting it, thus allowing the skin to get super crispy and lean. Most of the fat simply drips off while the duck is being sliced at your table side. Our server recommended the whole snapper with black bean sauce. I haven't had fried whole fish this amazing since my trip to Hong Kong.  Presentation of the duck and snapper are excellent. Really impressive authentic Chinese food (except the fried rice which was not good)"
"They are known for their Peking Duck and Beggars Chicken which is a chicken makes inside a giant bread ball.  The bread ball is too hard to eat and is just for show b/c you have to crack it with a mini hammer. Peking duck usually needs to be ordered a day in advance but you may be lucky and be able To order same day since they make extras sometimes. Duck is the best thing: crispy and fresh and they carve it at your table. Small, hole in the wall place. U can eat the duck with steamed buns or the crepe like pancakes but I love both! ""Other items on the menu like twiced cook pork and mapo tofu are standard and decent. Banana chocolate eggrolls are a nice sweet treat for dessert. I'd go back for more duck and crepes. Beggars chicken is good but more for show. Good for groups but it's a small place so reserve!"
Read the reviews and stopped by. Sat down and were asked for drinks. We asked if they have mineral or sparkling water (our preference) = doesn't have any. Asked for bottled water = doesn't have any. Asked if their water was filtered. Waitress went back to ask and said no just tap water. We got up and left but not before telling them that they should have more options than sodas. They apologized which was decent. Sad in my opinion since I would have loved to try their food.
"Mr. Wok is a Chinese restaurant in Plano that is known for an excellent Peking Duck dish they serve.  It's also located in a renovated Pizza Hut.  You'll find some other good dishes here but if you're going to only make one visit, order the Peking Duck.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - It's in a renovated Pizza Hut.  I know I said it already but there are implications.  First, it's a popular/busy spot so parking is limited.  Also, they try to squeeze in as many tables as possible that the result is there's very little room between tables/chairs.  On really busy nights there may be wait so make reservations and call in your Peking Duck order.   1/2 Star.Service - Our server was awesome.  I could tell that not only was he used to working with large groups but with tight spaces.  As dishes started coming out for our party of 10, he was able to expertly move, combine, and find spots to keep food going on the lazy Susan.  Add the fact the drinks remained full the whole time in the chaotic atmosphere leads to one finely skilled server.  1 Star.Food - This the third time I'm mentioning the Peking Duck.  They bring it to your table, cut/carve it up, and then serve it up with steamed buns or pancakes.  I preferred the thin pancakes but it's nice to have an option.  What's great is that there's no bone, it's hot & fresh, and is the best Peking Duck I've had in DFW.  Definitely the best dish they have....and the most memorable.  The rest of the dishes were forgettable, including the mango shrimp that I couldn't decide if I should have eaten it hot or cold.  Bottom line is that while the one dish they made was the best I had in DFW, I can't recall anything else I really liked.  But best in DFW does carry a lot of weight.  1 Star.Will I Return? - When they move to a bigger place.  I feel Mr. Wok needs to be moved to a new, bigger space.  The old Pizza Hut is actually cool, but it's not claustrophobic friendly.  The Peking Duck is outstanding and is a no brainer to order.  I guess even if they stay put I'll still be a huge fan of this signature dish.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
"Customer service here deserves a 3. Called in ahead to make a reservation and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes. I had to order my food ahead for the group so that when the seat us, the food would be ready. Once we were seated, we got all our food right away. The peking duck came in a little later. I gave this restuarant a 4 just because of the duck. One of the best ive had because it wasnt greasy or fatty at all. Very lean and it came with the pancakes and bao. Overall, good chinese food for DFW."
"Another great Peking duck experience at Mr. Wok. Well worth the long drive and 45-minute wait for the freshly roasted bird with the crispiest of skins.Bonus: 2nd course with the bones is included, either soup or stir-fried with pickled cabbage. Yum!Pro Tip: Remember to bring your favorite adult beverage as it is BYOB with no corkage fee... The Tom Thumb store at the corner of 14th and Jupiter has a very nice selection of chilled wines and beers.Don't forget to tell Jack and Allison that the Deep Ellum Duo sent you! :)"
"Cheater! The 10% off discount from Dealmoon is just for Beijing duck not all, but the coupon indicates that it is for all dishes, and the food taste like crap!"
"Very small place, I don't think they deliver everything I try a new place I get the fried rice first the reason why? Because it's very hard to mess up that dish and I don't want to waste my money on more expensive dishes if they can't even get fried rice right. Well I must report that unfortunately they didnt,get the fried rice right"
Loved owner Jake and waitress Eary.High quality very flavorful food. Tried crispy tangy beef and it was sweet and yummy. Packed
"Best Peking Duck I have had stateside! There are many reviews on the duck so I want to recommend a few hidden gems.While some of these dishes sound super Americanized, I promise they are good.Eggplant in Garlic Sauce(option:+shredded pork): The way they cut their eggplant is very different. It comes in much smaller pieces so the flavour really sink in. Delicious! Mango Shrimp: I wish they have more shrimp in this dish but it has an interesting hot(fried shrimp) vs. cold(mango) silky taste.Stir Fry Bean Sprouts: I think this dish costs less than $5 and it is done very well. A very crispy veggie dish you just cannot put down.This place is tiny (I think no more than 10 tables), thus it is always packed. Definitely call ahead if you want to visit on the weekends."
"Food was just okay. Shrimp fried rice contained very small, undeviened shrimp. I picked up to go. Fly in the area where I was getting food. Didn't seem to be the cleanest place. Waitress came from outside and assisted with bagging food without washing hands. Prices were reasonable is the only positive I had."
"Two words: Peking duck. This is something you should definitely try. Cute little place in Plano. Usually busy on the weekends so make reservation if possible. This is also a great place for family dining. For additional entrees, try their mango shrimp and eggplant. Every option on the menu is quite satisfying especially when it comes with a good price."
The Peking duck and stir fry is amazing! I also would recommend the fried calamari! :) Jack and his team are always very pleasant and we come back for the great food and service!
"Had a surprise birthday party here for my wife. They were very accomadating for the party. They gave a big enough table for thr entire party and small table for cake and alcohol (its BYOB). They appetizers were good especially the sampler platter. The peking duck was by far the best ever, it tasted like butter with the crispy skin and its succulant meat. They take the meat from the meat and make it into a soup or stir fry which is delicious. The customer service at this place was excellent. They were very accomadating and friendly. The owner working in the kitchen was very comforting however he greeted and took time to talk to us. There were pictures of celebrities on the including Troy Aikman. If this place is good enough for him then its good enough for me. I  am definitely coming back here."
"Don't be fooled by the exterior, this former Pizza Inn in an older neighborhood houses a killer Asian restaurant! I was turned on to Mr Wok by a friend several years ago. We are now regulars. I have never had a bad dish there and the Peking Duck is a best ever. Pad Thai is great too. My wife loves the Fried Rice and since she orders it everywhere we go, I guess she'd know!The prices are very reasonable, even cheap for the quality. It's cheerfully BYOB which saves even more since my wife enjoys wine with her dinner.Word is out and this place gets very busy nearly any day of the week. Go early or expect a wait, but they do take reservations if you have 6+ people or order a duck. Duck is supposed to be ordered in advance but I've had good luck walking in and getting one early in the evening, they are so popular they make extras.You do have to understand the service. Not only is it almost always crowded and busy, but food comes out when it's ready rather than trying to serve everyone at the table at the same time. This may be a cultural difference and certainly works if you are sharing dishes at the table and does ensure each dish is fresh and hot, but if you are doing the each to his own order thing someone may get to watch everyone else eat for a while. Better to share and enjoy anyway, it's all going to be good!"
"the peking duck here has to be ordered in advance, but it's totally worth it. nothing like seeing your duck carved at the table right in front of you. my favorite dish here!"
Quick update: the peking duck here is truly an AMAZING and incredibly flavorful experience. You must call ahead of time to reserve yourself a duck but it is a MUST! and its very filling! My husband and I have gone several times now and we always have leftovers to take home!
"I definitely want to take my family here one day. We had the beggars chicken, Peking duck, combination Cantonese stir fry, and chocolate banana egg roll. You have to call 2 days ahead for the chicken and 1 day for the duck. The Cantonese stir fry isn't on the menu but we saw a picture of it on the wall.I've never seen food presented in this manner before. The chicken was stuffed with some rice/herbs and the chicken was baked for 22 hours in some bread. They let you ""beat"" the bread before they cut it open for you at the table. So everybody's in the restaurant will stare at you because of the noise. The duck is actually sliced in front of you where you can choose between either some tortilla or a bao (get the bao). They give you an option to use the remaining bones and meat to either make a stir fry or a soup. I didn't really like the chicken that much bc the duck was soo much better, but it was still delicious. The duck skin was so crispy! It comes with the typical dipping sauce and some green vegetable. The chicken was pretty moist that the meat easily pulled apart when you're digging into it.The stir fry had a tasty sweet sauce topped onto the crispy pan fried noodles. I would recommend the stir fry and Peking duck!The chicken was like $35, duck was $32, and stir fry was less than $8 bucks? The price is really cheap since they give you a large portion. I looked through the rest of the menu and I don't think i saw anything over 10 bucks. They have lunch specials for around 6 bucks!This place is BYOB. The waitress originally gave us the regular American menu but then the owner dropped off the Chinese menu that has more options to choose from."
Had the Sesame Chicken lunch special today!  Unbelievably priced ($6.22!) and I literally ate everything in the plate! Not even shredded lettuce garnish was left behind because of that sauce! The vast demographic of customers this place brings in speaks volumes for how loved this place is by almost everyone who's ever tried it.
Easily the best Chinese food we've had in Dallas. We had Peking duck and orange beef. Outstanding!
"Always a great dining experience. Our server Alma was the best, having properly taken care of us and practically the whole restaurant as well. Full house on a Tuesday night which should tell you how good of a restaurant this is. Buff owner carved our duck and has an awesome personality. Not a single thing to say negative. It was all good and highly recommended. Good job Mr. Wok!"
"I really enjoyed my first visit tonight to Mr. Wok in Plano. I've heard very good things from friends & family and read excellent reviews. My cousin invited me to dinner for a very belated birthday dinner. It was a Friday night and quite busy. Our waiter David had a very large table & it took him awhile to greet us and bring us some water. Once he did we ordered appetizers and our entrees. First we had the edamame which is wonderful and has a nice smokey taste because it's tossed in a wok before it is served. I had a cup of hot & sour soup and the potstickers which were pan fried and delicious. For our entrees I had the sesame beef with fried rice and my cousin had the shrimp pad thai. I tasted it and it was very good, the sauce was very tasty. For dessert we shared the banana & chocolate filled spring rolls with caramel sauce. So delicious - yummy! Loved them :)David was a great waiter, very friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. The owner/chef also stopped by our table. He confirmed what we had earlier asked our waiter - whether they use msg or not. He said NO! I am thrilled as a very well known high end Chinese restaurant in west Plano still uses msg and have refused to make dishes without it for a close friend of mine who cannot consume anything with it, it gives her severe migraines and makes her quite ill. Thankfully we now have an excellent option so that we can all dine together. Highly recommend you try Mr. Wok. It's primarily a Chinese restaurant with some Thai and other Asian dishes. It is not a huge restaurant so go early or make a reservation. They're famous for their Peking duck which must be preordered as well as the Beggar's Chicken.  Hope to try those soon too."
This is by far my favorite place to eat. I try to get here at least once a week...it's not much to look at but they have phenomenal food and great prices. I would have never thought to eat Peking Duck but I tried it and I literally crave it all the time. I have had the 2nd course both stir fried and in the soup and I will say I prefer the soup but it is good either way. I really could ramble on and on about this place but long story short is that they are by far the best Asian restaurant I have ever been to. I would recommend this to everyone from the hardcore fan and the sesame chicken type fan. Have fun and tell Jack and Evelyn I said hello!
"We just finished the best dinner we have had in a long time at Mr. Wok in Plano.  We had a group of seven and an early reservation (4:30 pm) so they gave us center seating with a big lazy Susan in the middle.  We called them yesterday to pre-order the Peking Duck.  We ordered 3 additional dishes in addition to the duck.  We had crispy beef, sesame chicken, Double wok seared, and sizzling seafood.  The Peking Duck carved table side was incredible.  Crispy skin with moist pieces of duck accented with scallions and hoisin sauce with either pancakes or buns (we ordered both).  All the other dishes were great as well, but the duck was the star.  We tried all three desserts; fried ice cream, fried chocolate banana, and fried banana.  All again were excellent.  Met the owner Jack and had a wonderful evening.  Now my new favorite restaurant."
"Located in a former full service Pizza Hut (remember those?), you might not expect excellent Chinese cuisine, but you'd be very mistaken. This place just goes from strength to strength. Whether you come for the Peking Duck (24 hours notice) or the wok seared edamame or the salt & pepper shrimp or the... Well, you get the pic. Everything is quality here. Just go there. You won't be disappointed. Wait! Nevermind. It's hard enough getting in there as it is. Forget I wrote anything ;)"
Peking duck here is very good and more traditional than most places. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was not crowed which I like. Fried rice was good but the fried green beans and tofu was not. It had great flavor but came out to soft for my taste. Can't wait to come back and try the fish.
"Best Chinese Food in DFW area! Great food and service... what more can you ask for? Must try dishes:-Peking duck (DUH) ... Oh yeah and you also have the option to get a soup or stir fry dish out of the leftover duck they don't use for the Peking duck entree! -Mango shrimp-Eggplant in garlic sauce (my personal fave)-Tofu with smoked salmonMake sure you make reservations a few days in advance and pre-order the Peking duck, if you want it. They get super packed for dinner, especially weekends. Enjoy!"
I love this renovated pizza hut.  So cute and quaint.Fantastic food.  Surprisingly inexpensive for good service and food.
"Service is great--everyone is really friendly to deal with!Out of their two major specialties, the Beggar's Chicken and the Peking Duck, my family and I had the Peking Duck. The Peking Duck was good--the duck was definitely fresh and tender, and the skin was really nice and crispy! I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it was definitely great. On the plus side, they take all the extra meat and bones and turn it into stir-fry (and I think there was another choice, but I can't remember what it is...), which was super tasty!However, the other food--eh, I'm not a big fan. Mr. Wok is a very typical Asian-Americanized Chinese restaurant. We ordered Crabmeat Soup, Sweet & Sour Tilapia, Fried Calamari, & Black Bean Chicken. None of it was... bad. But I didn't think the food here was worth it. It was very typically Americanized and very unauthentic for Chinese food (I mean, there were green peas in my soup and my fish, which you don't see in actual Chinese dishes...), and nothing specially tasty. I wouldn't mind coming back again--but for the Peking Duck alone, which was definitely enough to garner four stars (plus good service). And maybe I'll try the Beggar's, because apparently that's super good too. If you're looking for good Chinese, I would stick to their specialties and avoid the rest."
"Busy busy busy even on a Wednesday. Peking duck (2), fried tofu, fried calamari and mango chicken.The wait staff really tried to accomodate everyone. Arrived at 6pm for reservations, within 30 minutes, all tables were busy and wait staff bustling all over. A+ for their hard work and effort.Peking ducks, om nom nom nom. Called earlier in the day for reservations and the 2 ducks. Ducks were served whole and then sliced at table. Make a mini duck burger with steamed buns or a wrap with the steamed pancakes. We had both! Duck was top notch quality. Juicy and super crispy skin. The leftover carcass could be stir fried in a hoisin/soy/green onion mixture so you can knaw what leftover meat was on there OR you can have a soup with bean thread noodles. Both was good!Fried tofu was silk tofu, lightly battered then fried. Tofu was soft and silky. Served with a peanut soy sauce. It's steaming hot so let it cool before eating.Fried calamari had the perfect seasoning and fried texture. Just the right amount of sweet and salty. So Delicious! The only con was maybe the quality of the calamari itself. The calamari, if really tasted, you will notice it's frozen calamari and may have been frozen for a little too long. But this doesn't stop us from ordering it everytime.Mango shrimp was a first for us. Served on lettuce in a fried wonton? bowl. Shrimp was battered and deep fried, then tossed in a mayo type of sauce with fresh sweet mangos. It tasted pretty interesting and good. Flavor not too strong to overpower the mango flavor. Not sure if it's a reorder item though.Byob! If u forget a bottle opener, they'll have one!"
Great food fantastic service I have only come for dinner with the family on a week night so we never have a problem getting seated several of great dishes Mongolian beef and hunan beef are great choices from the dinner specials the come with fried or steamed rice and an egg roll or soup. I believe the place is byob.
"Possibly my favorite Chinese place in DFW along with YAO FUZI.actually the only thing i want/need is the peking duck. ive only gotten duck like 7-10 times in my life and im freakin asian. i dont usually get it because either a) its greasy as hell and b) VERY VERY boney. they take care of both of these because they used compressed air during the roasting process underneath the skin to render out a ton of the fat so your not just eating fat with some meat. also some great guys come over and slice it all up for you so that you dont have to work so hard at it. the service was EXTREMELY friendly and you see why asians are there. thats how you know an asian restaurant was good. decent crowd even on a friday.i plan to try the beggars chicken next time but it requires 2 day call in. GO TO THIS PLACE NOW. IM GETTING TEARY EYED THINKING OF IT.JEANS: OK by far, even with tshirtORDER: at counter"
"Make reservation. Reserve not only seat but also Beggar Chicken, Peking Duct. Bring your own wine. Expect waiting 15,20 minutes, even with reservation. Expect noisy, homey atmosphere.  Expect crowds and parking on bingo area."
"I'm in love. I called the day before to make a reservation and reserve a duck. Post Christmas and pre NYE, the place was packed with big parties. Our reservation was for 7:30, but it took roughly 20 minutes to be seated. I wasn't mad though. It was chaotically busy, and the manager/owner (?) did his best to accommodate us after I inquired how much longer the wait would be. Thank you! Our server was very sweet even though she was busy. Our appetizers came out quickly. The hot and sour soup is delicious and truly sour. The duck was carved table side and we got the fluffy white buns although they do have the flat pancakes too. It was the best duck I've had since a trip to China ten years ago. I didn't know we had such good duck in Texas! It beats any Chinatown duck in San Francisco. I can't wait to come back. I literally think about this duck sometimes and how much I want one again. Random note: you can choose a duck soup or stir fry for the rest of your duck. I opted for half and half and they were both DELICIOUS. For 30 something dollars you get two courses for two people which is four meals. Incredibly worth it. I am genuinely curious as to whether they use your specific duck or just have a bunch of random ducks from everybody else and portion it out without separating your duck from the others. Not that it matters but I am just curious."
"Mr. Wok seems like a very Americanized Chinese place.They menu seems to include Chinese, Japanese & Thai dishes and the staff seemed so American, that I'm not even sure if they speak Chinese.  As a result, the clientele was all American.Bring your own wine.Ordered:-Crispy Tofu-Appetizer Sampler-Pad Thai-Eggplant-Bok Choy & Mushrooms-Peking Duck (Stir fried second)Everything except for the Peking duck was boring & uninteresting.The Peking duck, however, was great.  Carved tableside, skin separated from meat, traditional pancakes instead of steamed buns & the carcass served in a second course.  The meat wasn't greasy, the skin was crispy,  & the carcass was delicious.__________________________Conclusion:(The Beggar's Chicken looked good, but required ordering 2 days in advance)The Peking Duck is fantastic.  The rest is skippable."
"Eating here without eating Peking duck is like going to chic fil a without eating chicken. The beggars chicken is another novel thing that is worth trying at least once.However I lack the same enthusiasm for the rest of the menu. The service is a bit slow at times and the place is packed during peak hours. But I'm not complaining cause I would imagine the cost of food would go up tremendously if they tried to address these problems.Jack is the most mild mannered and friendliest person you'd ever meet for having 18"" arms. Overall this is one of the must try places if you are trying to get authentic chinese food in plano."
"Beijing duck is good! But remember reserve that one or two days ago.Duck with the pancake which is right exactly the same way that we had in Taiwan. However, the sauce is a little bit sour.  In my memory, the sauce should be sweet and salty, but not sour.Fried water Spinach is just exactly good as in Taiwan.Fried egg plants with pork is also great!The fried fish looks amazing but I think it's too greasy for me.  My friends finished that big fish, and they said it was good!"
"Best Chinese food in Plano!!I'm not a big Chinese food person but I landed here last week since I couldn't find a table at a big name Asian restaurant. We were a party of eight. We ordered a lot of dishes including the Peking duck (two courses), fried rice, whole snapper, noodles, beef etc. I ll admit the summer noodles weren't the best but everything else more than exceeded my expectations. Service is awesome and servers are polite too. A must try for Chinese food lovers."
"Food was very good. Like most people have already stated, even with reservation, expect an additional 15 to 30 minutes wait because this place stays packed. Also reserve peking ducks and beggars chicken if this is want you are wanting to try. Also of equal importance is BYOB. Owner is also very friendly which is a plus."
- Great lunch or dinner spot - Better then typical chinese food spots. Higher quality
"I see that one of my friends who I came to Mr. Wok with has already written a stellar review (Victoria W., I'm calling you out), so let me try to top her. My only reliable comparison of Peking Duck is to Houston's choices of amazing Chinese food. The neat thing about this place is you can order the peking duck with the fluffy buns or the tortilla wraps. For Mr. Wok, I prefer the buns. Everything else was delicious and it was also new to me that they shave the duck in front of you. Please refer to Victoria W.'s review should you wish to compare it to actual Chinese food in China... Ok, where was I? Oh yeah, the service was fast and great! We ordered one peking duck and several side dishes. Unfortunately I can't recall how much it came out to be but splitting tons of food five ways was extremely affordable. Perhaps I was too excited about playing Bingo next door afterwards. I apologize. It's a bit stuffy in there but worth it! Make sure to make reservations ahead of time and specify that you're reserving a duck (or two, or three)."
"This place might be our best find yet. It was packed on a Saturday night and we had to wait almost an hour - but it was worth it. We enjoyed the sampler tray to start (the puffed shrimp and crab ragoons were a mazing.)We then shared the combination fried rice, sizzling sea food skillet and chicken with green beans. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked - not greasy or over fried. We also went home with lots of leftovers. We want to go back and try the pecking duck. And everything else."
Best duck in Texas!!All the foods are pretty customizable to fit your likings as wellsuper awesome
"My friends and I were looking for a place to eat Peking duck in Dallas Texas and Mr.Wok is the place! The duck was amazing and it's just like how they offer it in China. They come to your table, shave the duck and you get to choose to eat the carcass in a soup dish or stir fry (choose the soup!) Make sure that you call ahead if you want to try the duck. You need to make reservations 24 hours in advance to reserve a duck, which is also a plus because it gets pretty packed! Another bonus to Mr. Wok is that it is BYOB!Other than that, it is a pretty much Americanized Chinese restaurant. The positive side is that there is good service. The negative is that the other dishes are typical of any other Americanized Chinese restaurant. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back. I want to try the Beggar's Chicken!"
"Small cozy restaurant looks like it might've been an old pizza hut. The place is always packed though. The food keeps you coming back! Get the peking duck (I think you might have to call ahead for it). It's great food and a show in one. The duck is carved in front of your face and is served with the traditional buns or tortilla. I recommend trying the tortilla out, it's definitely better than using the bun!The mango shrimp is also another one of my favorites. YUM!"
"Everything we had was awesome; even the server.  We started with potstickers and stir fried edamame.  So good we ordered more.  Then shrimp pai tai, mango shrimp, tangy crispy beef and crispy sizzling rice soup.  When your picky 8 year old says it's the best place ever, you know it must be good."
"I remembered to order the duck 24 hours in advance and we got there at 5:30 so it wasn't crowded until we were leaving. I hope I don't get thrown out of Yelp for this but I wasn't wild about the duck. Even the thin slices were really chewy. I thought it would be really tender. But the stir fry they make with the bones was amazing - really intense flavor and texture. The owner came by the table (what a sweetheart!) and told us it's made with mustard greens. I've never had anything like it. We had the soup when we got home and it was still steaming hot. The broth had a good duck flavor and the veg was good but the bones were distracting. I'd have strained them out first. It was a big duck. Even with  two big eaters we took home enough for another meal for two. Big duck. The lo mein, veg and beef egg rolls and egg drop soup were good and the stir fry was a spectacular course. The service was great so I'm going four stars but the duck by itself would have only been three."
"Our first dinner in Plano. Wow, this place is really popular! We came in around 8:30pm and its all full. We had to wait for about 30 min for a table, but the Peking duck is well worth the wait! I like Peking duck a lot but I can't eat much because of the fatty and oily skin, however here it's not really fat and grease, I really enjoyed it. One suggestion if I may, the wrap/bread/whatever u call it coming with duck is too big and too thick... Smaller size and thinner texture will further enhance the taste I think."
"I was hesitant to try this place out because I was never a fan of duck, but I was told that I HAD to try Peking duck since I haven't had it..... and ever since I was introduced to this place a few months ago, when someone suggests we eat Peking Duck, I'm automatically down. We always call ahead to reserve a duck or to make sure its still available. They bring the duck to your table and cut it in front of you, so if you get a little quesy seeing stuff like that, you've been warned! After they cut it, they given you the option of having stir fry or soup with the remaining duck/meat, and we always get the stir fry. Everything is perfect and I've never had a bad experience eating Peking Duck here at Mr. Wok. From the Buns to the sauce to the stir fry, everything is just so good! I've tried a few other dishes here but the Peking duck is by far my favorite."
"Came here on a Tuesday night and this cozy place was packed! They managed to squeeze us in.  We tried the peking duck, fried snapper, calamari, eggplant,  green beans,  ma po tofu and edamame, and everything was delicious.  The duck was flavorful and with crispy skin.  They serve the carcass separately air fried and in soup for 2 additional entrees that were also very good.  The highlights of the meal second to the duck were the eggplant and calamari.  This place is also incredibly well priced.  My only regret is not trying more.   I will be back for more delicious Chinese food!"
I have been trying Peking duck in many places. I can say Mr. Wok has the best Peking Ducking in Dallas area.
"Reservation , we were right on time . We were told they were behind 10 minutes. this was no problem.  45 minutes after we watched everyone that walked in get seated before us.  We kept asking if we were going to be seated next that we had a reservation and had pre-ordered a duck, envisioned the poor duck in the back dry and cold, we asked some people in line if they had reservations--no.  All we could figure is that there was some race discrimination going on--what else could it be?  We were well dressed and polite so...We won't be back  and we will tell Everyone at our very large companies not to try Mr. Wok after all, there are s00000 many good restaurants of this type in the area!"
"Love the Peking duck here. Definitely one of the best ones in the area! Since it's a two course Peking duck, get the stir fried for the second part it's amazing. The way they cook it is very flavorful. TIP Make a reservation ahead of time so you don't have to wait and to reserve your duck as well.I also recommended the fired red snapper - it was delicious."
This is a two in one type of Chinese restaurant. It's so rare to find an Asian restaurant that specialize in both traditional and Americanized dishes. They have stuff like Peking duck for family style sharing on one hand and dishes like sesame chicken on the other. Great lunch specials and daily specials. Can't say anything bad about Mr.Wok...the only thing left to add is that they also have good service.
"Mr. Wok is a small cozy restaurant that was pretty crowded for dinner.  Good thing we had reservations since our party was pretty big (11 people and 2 high  chairs).  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  Sitting elbow-to-elbow added to the family-style experience.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, ensuring our drinks were always refilled throughout dinner and accommodating our requests.The food was excellent!  The starters we tried included the wok-seared edamame (unique flavor and texture for edamame), salt and pepper calamari, cool lettuce wraps, and the crispy tofu (very crispy texure).  Entrees included: mango shrimp (least favorite dish of the menu due to the heavy rich sauce and sseroggy battered shrimp), fried green beans, beef with scallions, whole steamed fish (flavorful and moist), yaki soba noodles, Beggar's chicken, and Peking duck.  The duck was crispy and juicy.  The duck was cut table side and we were left to assemble the pancake wraps with fresh scallions and hoisin sauce. The server even let my 6 year old nephew try to break open the bread surrounding the Beggar's chicken dish, which was very entertaining.The table behind us was celebrating a couple's 50th wedding anniversary with family.  This place is great for family reunions and celebrations, and for sharing an intimate, delicious meal with loved ones."
"This is an updated review, following a thorough response from the business owner.  I'm just going to say that this place is not my favorite.  ""Your mileage may vary."""
"Great food. Great people. Make sure you have reservations! And BYOB. You definitely don't come here for the ambience, and the restaurant is a little small, but if you're looking for awesome authentic Asian cuisine, you must come here. I recommend the Peking duck, but make sure you let them know when you book your reservation or they may not have one for you."
"All I can say is that it's worth a trip to Plano to visit this place.  It is not the best Chinese food ever, but for the price, it is absolutely phenomenal.  Mr. Wok is located in an old Pizza Hut location, and brings all of the goodness of that low overhead to it's prices.  Because of the small size though, the wait can be a little long at peak times.  Consistently rated in the ""top restaurants in Dallas"" lists, it's really a hidden gem.  They have an incredibly wide selection on their menu -- on the last trip, I had the hot and sour soup (great), an egg roll, and the twice cooked pork (also really good!).  Other folks at the table had crunchy beef (yum), spicy shrimp, and spicy basil noodles.  They were all pleased, and lots of sharing occurred.  The best part: we fed a table of six, with lots of appetizers, for $85.  This is the genius of Mr. Wok -- great food and outstanding value.  Awesome!"
"I first came here 2 years ago to try their ramen. I wasn't a fan. A couple of days ago, my friend suggested we eat here for their peking duck. We called the day before to make a reservation for a table and the duck. It came with both traditional buns and thin ""pancakes,"" which were essentially tortillas that you could get at the store. They carve the duck right at your table side and ask if you would like a stir-fry or soup made with the bones. We picked stir-fry - it was good but I wished they just carved all of it instead of making it into a stir-fry. The actual peking duck was delicious though. The skin was very crispy! It's not the best I've had but I was definitely satisfied. On the other hand, my table ordered 4 more dishes and they weren't that good. Portions were also small."
"If you have a hankering for Peking duck, Mr Wok is the place to be. I have to say, Mr. Wok's duck does live up to the lean all natural grade name. At Mr Wok, you will NOT find fat in between the skin and meat of the duck. You will be able to chew on the crispy duck skin without the gelatinous fat. *YUMS* My only issue with the whole Peking duck course is that the steam buns were not the best i've had. It did not seem fluffy, fresh and spongy. The skin wrap on the other hand was a much bigger disappointment. Definitely go for the steam buns here if you have to pick the lesser of two evils. Overall, a great place to have Peking duck at an AFFORDABLE price. I will be back to try the beggar's chicken. Just wished the steam buns were perfected a little more!"
"Without a doubt, the only place I will go to for Peking Duck. Mr. Wok is a tiny restaurant with very limited parking and an average Chinese menu but their Peking Duck is literally perfection. The duck is so delicious that you have to reserve your duck a day prior at least to ensure you'll have one. I love how they bring the duck to your table and cut it in front of you and that they take the bones to make a soup or stir fry. The duck wrapped within the buns they provide is so good and it's nice that they offer additional buns at no cost. It is definitely the leanest duck I've had but at the same time, not dry. We also got the eggplant with pork which was good. The Mango Shrimp is tasty but very small portion for the price. The Sampler Starter is something fun to order and allows you to try quite a few things but out of the six appetizers on the sampler, I probably only found one or two to my liking. I highly recommend this restaurant for the Peking Duck."
"So it turns out that my current roomie grew up next door to the owner of this fine establishment.  She told me that they are the best Chinese restaurant in the DFW area.  I was rather skeptical since I'm such a snob so of course I needed to try it out myself.  Thankfully I was in town for a work trip and our hotel was a mere 10 minutes away. We arrived rather early [they were still setting up the dining room!], and we had our choice of tables.  We told them that we heard the Peking Duck was amazing but knew we had to order it a day ahead.  Luckily they make a couple extra and we were able to get one since we were the first people to arrive.  Lucky us!We ordered some calamari and Cho Cho for an appetizer.  What a great start to the meal.  If it was an indicator for how excellent the meal was, I knew we were in for a treat.When the duck was ready, the owner stopped by our table to carve it for us and told us the story about why their duck is superior to others.  Woah!  He was right!  The meat was so dang tender and the skin was perfectly crispy.  How'd they do it?!  Magic I tell you!  Absolute sorcery!!!For the second course of the duck we had it as a stir-fry.  That was amazing as well.  So many flavors!This is definitely one yummy quacker!!!Next time I am in town I know I will be coming back here!!!! Thanks Jack!!!  :)"
"Wowzers! This place is so authentic! The beef fried rice isn't loaded with soy or over-fried, it is cooked to perfection! The beef & broccoli is so juicy. The owner greets you upon entering & is so friendly! I have read numerous reviews on their Peking duck, so we asked the owner about the ordering process & he said they will be able to have it ready with a 24hr advance notice, so that will be next on the menu. This place has won so many recognitions! There are pics of Dallas Cowboys & Stars players dining here. And it is 5 mins from my new place so that's a score! Love local!!! I'll update my review after trying the duck...to be continued..."
"Oh Mr. Wok, I love you. You keep me hangin' on. In addition to the Peking duck being the star of the show, this place also makes other great dishes. Definitely get their red snapper and the green beans in garlic sauce. Do make a reservation because that's the only way you will avoid waiting in the cramped foyer eyeing everyone else, enduring a 1 hour wait!"
"PEKING DUCK = BOMB! although it requires an extra step of having to pre-order it, just doooo it. You will be glad that you did! I usually come here with a fairly big group so we end up ordering family style.  A lot of the dishes that i've had don't really stand out to me.  I think a lot of people, like myself come here for the Peking duck.  The beggar's chicken is also something cool on their menu but I think it's just neat in terms of presentation but not sure if it's worth it for the taste.  The chicken soup (small size) is HUMONGOUS and will feed a lot of people despite the the recommended portion size of 8-10.  There's supposed to be a lot of good healthy stuff in the soup but I am just not a fan.  It's super bland to me; perhaps it's because i specifically told them to leave out the msg. I want to praise their staff!  They are very friendly and constantly checks up on you! Amazing customer service!  I know asian restaurants have a rep for poor customer service but not here!"
"Mr.Wok has been around since my middle school and high school days and they have THE BEST peking duck. It's always on point and Jack, the owner usually does a cool job carving it in front of you and then they make a delicious soup out of the bones. My other favorite dish there is the mango shrimp! It's so good and different from your typical dishes at Chinese restaurants. Also I never like lettuce wraps at other restaurants but theirs are fresh and full of meat. Definitely try this place out if you like Chinese food! The owners are so friendly and the food is great!"
"Love the food here! Words cannot describe how awesome this place is! This place is tucked away in East Plano, where you often may forget its existence! Gather your friends and family, come out here and enjoy a traditional Chinese dinner together. They're always busy, even at 9pm! It's crazy. You may have to call ahead to reserve your Peking Duck. That's a dish that often is ""sold out!"""
"We went based primarily on the great Yelp reviews.  All in all, it was a great experience.  It was very busy on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away.  Our server was new, but he did a great job and knew a lot about the menu.  There were 3 of us.  One had the mango shrimp.  He said the shrimp were really good, but the mango was just a bit green.  I had a spicy beef dish (forgot the name), and it was great - very fresh tasting with green beans.  Our friend had the green bean dish which she said was outstanding.  We also had two appetizers - crispy fried tofu and potstickers.  Definitely.After we finished eating, the manager (or owner) came by and asked how everything was and thanked us for coming.  We had mentioned to the server when ordering that it was our first time there, and he must have shared that with the manager.  Really nice touch. We will definitely go back.  Both the server and manager mentioned the Peking Duck and suggested ordering in advance.  Will definitely be giving that a try. If you want great food and good service, this is a must.  It's not much for ambiance, but quite frankly, it was a non-issue.  I reserve my 5th star for after I've tried the Peking DuckOh...they do take reservations, and based on the Thursday night crowd, I'll definitely make a reservation next time (even though we didn't have to wait to be seated)."
"The Peking duck is so good. It's a 3 course meal with an excellent presentation. Also, have to note the calamari, pan seared edamame, eggplant and whole tilapia in black bean sauce were very good. Make a reservation or plan to wait a good while."
"I never thought I would be writing a review of a place called Mr. Wok that's located in an old Pizza Hut building in suburban Dallas, but here I am.  And while I'm not Asian I have the say the food on multiple visits has been consistently good - and most of the clientele is Asian.  Quite frankly it's a bit of a strange menu of different flavors including edamame, lettuce wraps, egg rolls, Chinese-American dishes, and even Pad Thai.  It seems to be mostly Chinese food for American tastes but there's a little something here for everybody and the food is consistently well made with good flavor.  As one of my colleagues described it, Mr. Wok is just what you expect from Chinese food - that's about as good as you're gonna get in North Texas."
"The food:Peking duck is amazing crispy and delicious when wrapped up. It's a good idea to reserve one before heading over, otherwise they may run out. They also make the rest of the duck into a soup or fried rice. Mango shrimp was good. Fresh mangos, wish there were more pieces of shrimp in it, howeverJapanese eggplant was tender and flavorfulFried tofu app was fried to perfectionOverall, everything I tried was good to amazingThe service:Prompt, friendly, helpful. Environment:Nothing to rave about. It's like a traditional Chinese restaurant. But I'd come back for the food and service."
"3.5 stars.I was so afraid that when I came to Plano that I would not find a decent Chinese restaurant. And I was kinda right and kinda wrong.I came here with a friend that was a strict vegetarian (no eggs/meat), and was very pleased that they are so accommodating here: essentially substituting any meat for no meat or tofu at your request on virtually any dish.  He ordered the Chow Fun with no meat and was more than pleased with it. It didn't look oily either like some Chow Funs can be.We started with these excellent Fried Crispy Tofu squares, soft tofu squares that were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and black sesame seeds and a tasty peanut sauce. Perfectly crisp and hot. Really good starter.I had the Mango prawns (one of the house specialties) and it was beautifully presented in a thin shelled fried bowl over crispy rice noodles. The only problem was that the fresh, sweet mango was so cold, that it actually cooled down the large prawns and the dish was oddly cool/cold. After having so many honey-walnut prawns that did not have this problem, it was unexpected to have this one turn out that way. That said, the mango was generous and very sweet, and the  prawns were perfectly done.The service was very friendly as well and there were lots of pictures of the dishes on display for the non-asians in all of us. They even had two versions of the menu (English+Chinese, and English only)The only nit pick was that I asked for a side of rice that was supposed to be fried rice, and the only thing fried about it was the color. It looked like they took steamed rice, sprayed it with enough soy sauce to make it light brown and then threw two or three peas and carrots in it to add color. It was not very good and I did not finish even this small bowl.I can't say that this place was very authentic but then I was not expecting it to be. I'd need to return to sample more of their dishes to be sure, but for now I'm rounding up to 4 stars."
"Absolutely great, I know you are reading my review but this is one out of many restaurant I would recommended to you HERE IS the reason whyFRIENDLY STAFFS: I'm telling you, they are so nice, not only they are taking care of you, they also make you feel like you are having a family meal.FOOD: I'm not saying they are the best I ever had but they are trying their best to provide you the best meal in the restaurant. (p/s: Manager will listen to what you have to say about your experience at his restaurant- share your thought y'all)Love this place:)"
This place is AMAZING! My husband and I will drive 30-40 minutes to fulfill our craving for this place. Our favorite is the peking duck and the cool wraps. You have at least 2 days worth of take home food too. Jack is super friendly and welcoming! He pretty much knows all of his customers very well. The staff is always friendly and ready to serve.  We will continue to keep coming here for many years to come. -Kimmi and Andy
"The duck is great, so is the new thin wraps that's much more authentic Beijing style."
"Fantastic Chinese food.  I tried the Rangoons, egg rolls, beef with broccoli and Kung pao chicken.  Excellent in taste.....Kung pao chicken could have been hotter but most Americans are weenies and can't handle it."
"Located on the east side of Plano in an unassuming standalone hole in the wall that looks like it used to be a Taco Bell or fried chicken joint.  Mr. Wok is a no frills kinda place, but plenty of culinary thrills.  The best Peking duck in the DFW area.  Love the table side finish of the duck, not too fatty and oh so good.  Order the buns to go with.  You also get the choice of soup or stirfry as a secondary dish from the duck bones.  I love the stirfry and gnawing on tasty bones, definitely the old school Asian girl in me.  And to top it off, it's BYOB!  Get out there.  It's good eats!!"
"It seems that everyone has heard of the Mr. Wok duck. It's their signature dish, served as a 3 course meal, but only if you get there in time! The duck must have renowned popularity because it was 86'd by dinner, even on a random mid-week night. But the fried tofu and ramen were still good substitutes! its BYOB, which is good or bad, depending on your preference. In case you arrive unprepared, the waitress noted that the gas station around the corner has a decent alcohol selection. IMHO, the decor could using some sprucing up. But the service was top notch!"
"Mr. Wok- I wanted to vomit after I left, but in a good way.This place is interesting. The building used to be a Pizza Hut and it still has remnants from its past which is amusing. I'm pretty sure the booths have been there since 1985, still very comfy. I would recommend reservations, this place isn't huge and gets very crowded very quickly on a weekend.We had the peking duck. I think some reviews said the duck had no flavor or was bland. I think where they are coming from is that the ducks they used (sourced from Long Island) are very lean. Without that fat, you get a different taste to the meat and even to the skin.  I prefer the fattier ducks since it makes the meat more moist and flavorful, but for a lean duck, this was very good. Definitely opt to pay a little extra for the steam buns for the duck; who the hell eats this stuff with tortillas? Weirdos. They also carve the duck for you which is nice- allows for lazy eating.We also had the mango shrimp, which was a nice switch, something refreshing after eating all the duck.  The milk sauce that is mixed with the mangoes might have been a bit much, made it a little too sweet. I would have preferred it without the sauce, but to each their own. And I still ate the whole thing up, so, whatever.Oh, I also ate all the crispy lo mein noodle things that came with my friend's soup at the beginning. Those were pretty good too, but I think it prevented me from eating a 5th duck bun.All in all, a fun experience with some tasty food. Not that expensive either, so that's always a plus. I think next time I'll have to try the beggar's chicken so I can bash the crap out of the loaf that the chicken is baked in."
Love this place and have been going there for years now.  My fave dishes are The calamariThe Chicken chahung& the seared edemameNo matter what I am in the mood for I order those 3 items. Yum. O and call ahead if you want the duck. it's also really good.
"I absolutely love this place. I first came here like 10 years ago, and the food has consistently been excellent since day one.My current favorite is the spicy parmesan prawns, they are spicy and delicious and just oh so good, and the great thing is they don't skimp on the portion."
"Came here for lunch, ordered Hunan chicken, nice sauce tons of veggies, we'll cooked, but not overdone, also had egg drop soup,  a little fancier than the normal fast food places, my only complaint is where's the chicken? My plate had micro pieces of chicken. But it's very tasty, rice was nice and abundant,  a little but not overly sticky"
"I have picked up take out from Mr. Wok several times and loved it.  Last night, my fiancee' and I went to dine in and liked it just as much. We started off with soup and an order of steamed dumplings.  The wonton soup is excellent and served in a cup size portion- perfect as a starter.  The steamed dumplings are filled with pork and cabbage and I love the sauce that comes with them. My fiancee' had the Four Treasures- Chicken, Shrimp, beef and pork in a garlic sauce served with noodles and really liked it.  I had the Cashew Chicken with fried rice.  The Cashew Chicken was the best I have had in a long time.  Compared to other Chinese places in the area- Mr. Wok is a bargain.  The prices are great and the restaurant is BYOB.  Will definitely go back soon with my family."
"This was our first time to try this place, but it won't be the last. Every item we ordered was awesome. The wok seared noodles were tasty. The shrimp fried rice was loaded with shrimp. Lastly, the Szechuan pork was just the right spicy and tasty at the same time.  We ordered both the egg drop and hot & sour soup. While the egg drop was excellent, the h&s needed a bit more cabbage and carrots to the broth. The place was packed an the service was still excellent."
"Please do not be fooled by the outside of the building, which appears to be a former Pizza Hut.  Mr. Wok puts people that judge a book by its cover to shame!I gave this place 5-stars because there is absolutely no other place in Big D that serves Peking Duck of this quality.  If you aren't a fan of duck skin, then this obviously isn't the place for you.  If you understand and enjoy the intricacy/complexity of roasting a duck, then this is duck heaven for you...Mr. Wok actually ships its all-natural ducks in from Long Island, NY.  They specifically use very low fat ducks to maximize the crispiness of the dish.  This is essential in Peking Duck!  It also prevents one from confusing juiciness with fat content, which is crucial PD mistake in many Chinese restaurants in the area.  The Peking Duck dish comes at around $30, but the owner slices up the skin in front of you, which only adds to the restaurant experience.  Afterwards, you have a choice of second dish by stir frying the remaining duck meat/bones or making a soup noodle broth.  Don't forget to call the day before to reserve your duck, because it's difficult to get them made-to-order.I also enjoy eating the ""Ton Chun"" soup noodles, which translates into homestyle noodles.  The soup broth is serious business--smoky in nature, which means that there is a long brewing process involved.  The noodles also come with julienned  vegetables and sliced, tenderized pork cutlets.  For the price, this huge bowl of soup noodles is a $7 bargain!Also, be sure to try out the mango shrimp and lettuce wraps.  Neither are outstanding, but great compliments to the PD."
"If you haven't been to this place, then you should try it out at least once. Be prepared though to wait in line if you haven't done any reservation. In this instance, my experience here was related to a friend who had a birthday party.We had several dishes family style, and I can vouch that every one of them was fantastic and tasted authentic. The peking duck is what the are known for and that was very good. Just to give you an idea, everywhere I have eaten Peking duck has had their very own signature.This location will bring the duck out and carve it there on the spot. The bun is fresh and so are the condiments needed. About the location though, ignore the fact that this used to be a pizzaria. Note that there isn't that many parking space, especially when its packed... and it was definitely packed that evening when I went there. Other then that, the staff was awesome and catered to our needs. I really like the place a lot and expect to show up again for Peking duck."
Best Peking Duck in Dallas! Went with my whole family and we all loved it.My Parents tried other dishes too and it all came out really good!. It's BYOB so we brought a bottle of wine. I have been trying to find a good place after I moved from San Antonio and finally found it we will be regular customers for sure!
Best Peking duck ever. Must call and reserve table in advance. They are alway booked. Super busy place.
"Peking Duck was excellent!The first course, that was....the second one (we had it stir fried) was just so-soBeggar's chicken was just ok....calamari was good, though a little saltyEdamame was really goodBut service, oh service, was BAAAAD-----underline BAAAAADthe waitress never bothered to ask us what we wanted or asked how we were doing....had to flag down the waitress three separate timesOnce to order foodSecond to ask where our beggar chicken wasThird was to ask where our duck wasFrom edamame/calamari, it was perhaps 20-25 min wait for the chicken, then another 20-25 min for the duck, then another 20 min for the stir-fried duck. Totally had to stop eating while waiting for the duck and chicken to come...intervals in between. Spent 2 hours (without actually eating the stir-fried duck, once it came, we asked for it to be put in doggy bag and left) in the establishment. And we came at 6.30 pm, when the restaurant was half-empty, so I don't know why we had to wait that long for the chicken./duck to come. Had made a reservation for the chicken 2 days prior.It looks like every table ordered Peking Duck without fail. So why we had to wait that long for the stir-fried duck, we didn't know....If you must have that Peking Duck, you can come.....but if you're limited on time, I'd advise you not to come here."
I would have loved to write a review on their food but here's their policy. They only make reservations for groups of 6 or more so DON'T plan of just showing up on a Saturday night and expect to be seated if there are just 2 of you.
"My family loves, loves, loves Chinese food. What do we eat at home? Chinese food. What do we eat when we go out? Chinese food. What kind of take-out food would you like? Chinese food. Would you like any other kind of ethnic food? Funnnnyy, go walk to McDonald's while mama and papa enjoy our Chinese food. :(Also- whenever my family eats at Chinese restaurants, it tends to be the same things:  some sort of soup, a meat dish (usually sweet and sour pork), a veggie dish (like a hot pot), combination fried rice, and fried flat beef noodles. Family full of adventurists willing to try new things coming to Mr. Wok, woo! (Note the sarcasm)Dad after a day of shopping: ""What would you like to eat?""...Yeah, okay.~~~~~~~Anyways, Mr. Wok was recommended to him by a friend who stated that their peking duck was phenomenal and that you had to try the restaurant at least once. This restaurant never would have stumbled across my father's radar of restaurants he would like to try if not for the said friend from above. It was a pretty early dinner (around 5 PM) so there wasn't any crowd at all and we were able to be seated fairly quickly. Service was great! We asked to be moved to a different table because it was right under lots of ceiling fans and we were accommodated to a booth when the table became available. Because this was a spur of the moment eating, we had no reservation for Peking duck or beggar's chicken, so poo...no duck for us. :( Actually...now looking at what we ordered, we actually did venture...kind of away from what we usually do...The food was ""eh.""First the fried rice and the yakisoba noodles came out and the presentation of the food was nicer than what I was expecting...except...IS THAT HAM IN MY FRIED RICE and you garnished it with pickled ginger?? Fine..fine. The yakisoba noodles were way too sweet and had to be eaten with white rice later on in the dish to help.Sweet and sour pork was plated beautifully too...except that I felt like I was being lied to. Sweet and sour pork. What do I expect in that dish? Sweet and sour pork. This dish had like..12 pieces (I'm being generous with this number) placed diagonally in a row  in a square plate with mounds of mushrooms, onions, and carrots on each side.What?! No Mr. Wok! No! Give me my meat! Steamed tilapia with a black bean sauce. Once again, plated beautifully. but why is there pork in this sauce? Too sweet, but the tilapia was very nicely steamed and was good. The sauce was a different matter. With the expectation of every dish being plated beautifully, they then brought out our fried duck. This dish was literally ""fried duck"" cut into pieces and pushed onto a plate and served to us. No garnish, no greenery under the fried duck to help with this shade of brown. Duck wasn't particularly flavorful and was on the dry side but I guess that's why they had the condiments on the side to dip it in. When comparing the prices of this Asian diner to other Chinese places, it is considered to be a bit higher (Probably paid ~$15 per person compared to the usual $8-9) for food that isn't considered worth it. Sure, it's still considered to be reasonable and cheap when compared to restaurant prices in general, but in the world of Asian restaurants, I do believe it is on the pricier side of average. Was the food worth the price? No.Was the service great? Yes! Was I wowed? NoWill I be back? Don't count on it unless it is to try out the infamous Peking duck. If 2 1/2 stars was possible, this would have been the rating I would have given. So my advice is to come here for the Peking duck but go elsewhere if you're craving more authentic Asian cuisine from other restaurants."
"We just moved here, and we were so excited to find a wonderful Chinese restaurant so quickly! The Peking Duck is simply delicious. Not at all greasy or boney. The Moo Shoo is also fantastic. Service is always wonderful: prompt & friendly without hovering. Prices are great, too. They don't serve alcohol, so bring your own. Atmosphere is very casual, and the restaurant isn't that large -- so make reservations or be prepared to wait a bit. But it's definitely worth it!"
"The Peking Duck with all the trimmings is curved table side by Jack the owner. The Chow fun noodles has that smoky taste. Quite a good place for a nice dinner at a  very reasonable price in a friendly atmosphere.. Service was quite alright  , though very busy on a Tuesday  at 6;00 . Weekends might be too crowded. Next time we'll try the Beggars  Chicken. I'm happy to find a new place  for food and value. We'llbe repeat customers for sure."
"Quack Quack Quack.One of the best things I've eaten in Dallas in a while......for $32, you get a Peking Duck served three ways- slow roasted and sliced, served with moo shoo pancakes, then stir fried with onions and some sort of greens, and then served in a soup.  Heavenly - the rest of the menu includes a stuffed chicken cooked 24 hours (Beggar's), a whole cooked fish, and a whole lotta other goodness.  Can't wait to come back."
"I'm not sure about the food. It wasn't bad just bland. The sweet and sour chicken was tasteless and the sauce wasn't sweet nor sour, it kind of had a chlorine taste to it, city water maybe? The beef and broccoli was excellent along with the chow mien. The portions were satisfactory as well. I might give it another shot but will try else where before I do."
"The one thing you need to know about this place is the Peking Duck.  You can't get this dish at many establishments in the area, and the fact that they actually know how to make Mr. Wok pretty awesome.  You will need to make sure you call in your order many hours before hand.  I would suggest you place your order in the morning because they need time to perfect this dish.  Their other stuff is decent, but there's honestly nothing special with their dishes compared to other restaurants.The decor is a little weird and you really do feel like you're in an Asian establishment as it's not exactly the cleanest place.  No worries as the aroma of your feast will overpower any strange scent you smell on your way in.  I will definitely be back soon!"
Best Chinese restaurant around my house. Love the food and great service it's always crowded so I always have to do take out!
"Soooo good! The place is a little outdated, but the food is among the best I've ever had. Service was excellent, price was very affordable. I highly recommend it."
Just spent 30 minutes waiting to be seated in a 1/2 full house...only to be told there was no seat available for an hour. What a waste. Terrible service. Was going here for a celebration dinner but will never be back.
"There aren't many places for Peking duck in the DFW area. This place, not only serves duck, but it is excellent. They serve it in two dishes-the second either being a stir fry or a traditional soup. The service is also dig-in fun. It is bring your own wine, and it is recommended to call ahead for your duck, but they usually have extras. Jack and Alison were great fun to visit. We will be back!"
"Hooooly DUCK. Didn't know ducks had that much protein...other places have always given me 80% fat and 20% meat. Mr. Wok proved me wrong. Following reviews, I ordered ahead and thank goodness I did, otherwise they would have run out. The waiter brought out the duck roasted to perfection and cut it in front of us. He plated the skin and meat and took the rest of the duck back to have it sautéed. (You can either have it sautéed or in a soup) this also was amazing. All in all, the pecking duck was ducking amazing, our waiter was helpful and friendly, the portion was perfect for two, and the duck was again...ducking delicious. I would suggest going on a weekday when it's less crowded. Again, order ahead! Will return to try the beggars chicken. Thanks Mr. Wok for the good duck experience. 5 stars and a happy dance from me!"
"I came here with a large group. We knew it would probably be busy so we made a reservation ahead of time. We got there early and they said we couldn't be seated until the time our reservation, which is fine. But when it's time for our reservation we go ask to see if a table is a ready and they said ""oh, we actually just put a group in the table we were going to seat you at. It'll be about 20 more minutes."" What! They let us order ahead of time before we sat so we got our food faster which is nice. But they messed up my order bad tried to say it was what it said on the menu, but they must have been looking at a different menu than me. The food was good but I the service was sub par."
"Don't get fooled by the physical appearance of this place.  Although it looks like an old Pizza Hut, the food alone will make you forget of the lack of decor.  I have dined here for many occasions last year and this year, and have not been disappointed by the food nor service.  It's BYOB here, they will provide you with ice and storage.  Food:  for the Peking duck, you must order this at least 1-2 days in advance.  The duck is crispy, and carved tableside.  For the duck meat, you have 2 options of getting tortillas or steamed buns to eat with.  For the left over duck bones that have alittle bit of meat still in tact on the bone, you also have 2 options eating that as well.  The server will carve the duck meat off of the bones, and ask you if you want to use the bones to make a duck soup or saute the bones.  Both options are good, if you go here enough times you should try both.  Mango shrimp:  this dish is slightly sweet from the fresh mangos that it is served with.  The shrimp is lightly battered, then fried and tossed in a mayonnaise type sauce, and served in a empty mango skin and a bed of fried glass noodles.  It's a spin off of the walnut shrimp at most chinese places.  Begger's chicken:  the chicken is marinated, wrapped in foil and then wrapped with dough that covers the entire chicken.  The chicken is then baked and brought out to your table.  You then get to pound on the harden dough to open up the chicken inside.  This dish definitely add entertainment value to your dinner, but takes a lot of work."
"Stopped here based on a recommendation from a coworker, and we weren't disappointed. Though the lo mein was made from spaghetti noodles (a pet peeve of mine), it was still tasty, as was my mom's almond chicken. Our crab rangoon appetizer looked a little well done, but they were ok none the less. Staff was nice, and the prices fair. We will be going back."
"my dad and i were super excited to try this place, given their ad in the chinese newspaper and how they were listed in dallas' top 100 restaurants (or something of that sort). after seeing the menu once we arrived, i was kindof skeptical because i've learned that generally, if your establishment cooks all of the various asian cuisines, then how good is the food? i decided to give mr. wok the benefit of the doubt, and my dad and i ended up ordering the two-course duck, marinated jellyfish, and ma po tofu. when the duck arrived, the waiters presented a whole duck and sliced the skin and meat in front of us, which made it look and smell all the more delicious. however, it was a huge, tasteless disappointment, especially at the price we paid and how popular mr. wok seemed, well, everywhere. the rest of the dishes were just the same: very, very mediocre. the ma po tofu was nowhere near spicy, and the marinated jellyfish was way too sweet. however, the point in our dinner when i decided mr. wok was just a no-go was when a fly landed on our jellyfish. disgusting, not to mention that it kept buzzing around our booth, too. when we pointed it out to the waiters, they didn't seem to really care that, well, there was a fly in their restaurant that would normally question their hygiene/health standards. the only part i actually enjoyed from the meal was the second course of the duck, the duck soup, which was very light and refreshing.overall, mr. wok was just a huge disappointment. the food was tolerable, but honestly i wouldn't come back. duck is way overhyped for what it's worth vs. what you get, and it bothers me that the staff seems so lax about flies in the restaurant."
"Mr. Wok what would I do without you?Although it's a bit of a trek from Uptown to get a meal at Mr. Wok, it's definitely always been worth it. The duck you get at Mr. Wok is the best you can get here in Dallas. It's perfectly cooked and the duck retains all it's wonderful and beautiful juices. The skin is crisped to perfection and the duck is carved expertly tableside. It comes with scallions, black bean paste, and chinese buns (no pun intended). You fill up the little warm buns with some crisp and juicy pieces of duck, put on a thin layer of black bean paste, throw some scallions on top and take a bite. The explosion of flavor and textures is ethereal. Then again, I've always liked duck so take that last comment with a grain of salt. They take the rest of the duck that's left over and will cook it for you 1 of 2 ways. 1. stir fry. 2. soup. Go for 1. It's much more flavorful and although there isn't a ton of meat left once the carving is complete, the stir fry flavor and little sinews of meat are worth the effort. As for the soup, it's bland and underwhelming.Did I ever tell you about the day I came here to Mr. Wok when they ran out of a duck? I was depressed for about a week. When I first heard they were all sold out, my heart sunk. When I saw them delivering the last of their pre sold ducks to other customers my heart shriveled up and died. Mr. Wok isn't Mr. Wok without the duck. You need the duck. The duck is a must. Let's say the duck disappeared. I woudln't come here."
"Went on a Saturday evening. Arrived at 6:20. I family waiting before us. Estimated wait for table: 90 minutes.I know the place is small but their policy of only accepting reservations for parties of 6 or more or for parties who pre-order the Peking Duck is ridiculous.I also do not believe that the entire restaurant was filled for the next 90 minutes with large parties and/or Peking Duck orders.I get the feeling, if you're a regular and the owner likes you, you'll get a table even without the above restrictions."
"You out there? Yes, you. The one reading this review. The one who is using Yelp because you are a rebel! You don't believe the hype your friends spew and you're skeptical of just how good something can be when clearly millions of people can be wrong (example: we live in a world where Martin Lawrence is probably plotting out the next seven ""Big Momma's House"" installments since he keeps getting funding for them). But I'm here to tell you that when it comes to Mr. Wok, the hype is justified. Believe it and see what all the fuss is about.My folks had gone here a couple of times already and after enough subtle hint dropping on my part that escalated into ""Hey, when do I get to go there?,"" I got my golden ticket invite to see what it is Mr. Wok does that makes the place so captivating. It all comes together pretty quickly when you hit the parking lot - the place is small enough to be charming but busy enough to warrant a sign that reads something along the lines of ""Extra parking in the Texas Bingo lot next door."" Yes, that's right - it is possible to blend awesome Asian Bistro food and bingo in the same immediate area. Add in the fact that the place looks to have been built into an old Pizza Hut, and the ""charm"" factor just exploded off of the charts. We walked in on a Saturday night (which is important to note) around 6:00 and the first thing that hit me was the layout: small walkway with bathrooms on the side leading in, kitchen to the right beyond that, and to the left a dining room of a few tables and those old school booths that are never as comfortable as you think they are. And the place was already filling up. We got a corner booth and set up shop with a pretty extensive menu.Mr. Wok's is BYOB, so keep that in mind if you're planning on stopping by to hopefully experience a raging kegger followed by fortune cookies. We set our beers on the table and our server was over faster than day. And speaking of our server... This girl gets points for not only being quick, knowledgeable and funny, but also for being quirky and not obnoxious. Seriously, take Zooey Deschanel, but make her likable, and add the dialogue from ""Juno,"" but make it tolerable, and you have this girl.And actually, everyone there was on their game. From food runners to drink re-fillers and a guy who managed to draw the shades at our booth without dislocating his arm out of his socket, everyone was engaging and amiable.But all this would be for nought if the food was lacking. And it is here where Mr. Wok's reputation shines. I'm not a lettuce wrap fan, which hurts my hipster cred, I'm sure, but they were polished off quickly at our table. Ditto the pork egg roll. And when it came time for the entrees, that was when I decided I would do my best to graze around the table as if I had never seen food before. I stuck with my chill garlic prawns, a dish that looks like it would be a disaster for anyone with facial hair (because it is) but no one should mind because it is that good (because it is). Finishing that off, I sampled the pad thai and was a fan, though not nearly as much of a fan as I was of the crispy beef. I considered ordering my own dish if not for the simple fact that dessert was on the horizon in the form of banana-chocolate spring rolls (please pause to wipe the drool) and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (ah, there's my hipster cred coming back to the limelight... and good thing, too, since that coffee was great). The point is, everything was exceptional.And I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the ""other"" factors at work here. Now all of this is heresy and rumor for me since I've been here once so take it in stride. The duck is -THE- dish here, and since business is booming, ordering one ahead of time is a surefire way to secure a reservation on the weekend... I believe. There are also meatballs that are not on the menu but can be prepared if given enough notice, and they knock the socks off of everyone in the building... I believe. And there's also a swimming pool on the roof where the girls from the camp across the lake relax... I'm almost 100 percent positive about this one.Bearing all that in mind, is it any wonder people continue to fill Mr. Wok's tables? It was a steady stream of patrons on our Saturday night visit and I'm pretty confident that's the norm most any other time of the week (except Sunday when no one is there... literally). Believe the hype, come for the food and make plans to do it all again."
Been coming here for lunch for years but finally got the family together for dinner and the famous Peking duck.   Came in with high expectations based on the reviews and they exceeded them.   Everything was great and leftovers the next day were just as good.    Will continue to make it in for lunch but will have to get the family together for the duck again.
"My bf's dad told us about this place and their Peking duck. We parked and thought, this place could be a hit or a really big miss. But don't be fooled by the look, or the non Asian girl being the waitress. Yeah, we had our doubts. But this place is really a hidden treasure. Sure, some of their stuff may be a little Americanized, but when it came down to the real stuff, it's really GOOD. Best Peking duck in DFW. It's a family owned business. They know what they're doing."
"One of my favorite restaurants in DFW! Whenever we have company in town this is our go to restaurant. The food is amazing and reasonably priced. A few of my favs are the duck, spicy beef, green bean and chicken, mango shrimp, edamame. The duck you need to call 24 hrs in advance. It's also BYOB! The owner Jack couldn't be any nicer and more dedicated to his restaurant. Try it you will not be disappointed."
"I have been here maybe 3 or 4 times total, 2 of those times for my friends Bday.  The same guys Bday both times.  The reason he loves coming here for his bday each year is that Peking Duck.  They do such a sick job carving that puppy.  They bring it out whole in front of you, the skin is so crispy and thin, the meat so nice as they carve it, its a wonderful sight to see.  The only down side of this is they often run out of duck, which blows.  Who would of thought there is ever a shortage of ducks ?!  There is like 30 of them out by the lake near my house, they just quack and piss me off at night.We had a reservation for 16 people total, and we had to share 1 duck, since thats all they had left.... which is probably the worlds hardest thing to do.  It ranks up there along with tight rope walking, nut checking yourself, and riding a unicycle. I guess it was our mistake since we only called that same day and all their ducks but one were already sold.   WHO SELLS DUCKS OUT BEFORE LUNCH ? WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THIS ?Anyways the mango shrimp dish was delicious, and so is the calamari dish.  I have no idea what its called, but we ordered 2 of those on our side of the table, and no regrets at all.  They are perfectly fried calamari with a nice spicy vinegar soy sauce mixture.  Tastes fantastic.  The restaurant is kind of in the middle of nowhere, by kind of I mean completely.  Its probably the last place you would expect to find a gourmet Chinese joint that specializes in Duck, which is quite expensive.  The dishes here are small but delicious.  If you ever go, PLEASE do yourself a favor and call in advance to reserve a duck.  For duck's sake, plan ahead.PS another hard thing to do is shoot yourself with a bbgun."
This is the second time I have been here. The service is excellent. We always get the duck and they always stand by the table and carve it up. We have a great time it's a great place to take your family and have fun please enjoy.  For the most important note the duck is absolutely phenomenal
"For the most part, this restaurant sucks.  How did it get 3 stars then?  Well let me tell you a story on my situation.  I was talking to this girl from the U.S. nation...The ""Chitty"" (and by chitty, I meant shitty) - - Mapo Tofu - This is not close to the usual Mapo Tofu I am used to ordering from Szechuan restaurants.  It came in a brown gravy type sauce instead of hot chili pepper sauce.  Bleck.  Only dish we didn't finish.The ""Meh...It's alright...but I'll eat it"" - - Cheese Shrimp - Parmesan crusted fried shrimp.  Meh.- Mango Shrimp - Not truly my cup of tea, either.  Somehow, the flavors did not mesh well for me.- Steamed Tilapia in Black Bean Sauce - Steamed because a girl asked for it steamed.  I personally wanted it fried.  Not the best tasting tilapia I've had.  Some areas of the fish were a little rough.  Not too much flavorThe ""Hey, I could get used to this"" -- Twice Cooked pork.  This dish had a very interesting flavor.  Basically pork belly deep fried, then stir fried.  Recommended.The ""WTF, that was incredible.  I think my balls just dropped"" - - Eggplant in Garlic Sauce with Pork - I AM A BIG FUCKING FAN OF EGGPLANT AT AN CHINESE RESTAURANT.  THIS EGGPLANT IMPRESSED ME THOROUGHLY.- Peking Duck - I have never had Peking duck like this before.  Duck was....BOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMBBBBBBBB.  So good...so good.These last two dishes took this place from a 1 star rating to a 3 star rating.  They put this restaurant on its back and took it to the house dou'...for Madden.So my recommendation.  Stay away from all the food except the two dishes I mentioned.Tip - If you don't want tortillas with your duck, just ask for the buns.  They have them for people that ask for them."
"Mr Wok is close to my office and I have picked up lunch from here many times in the past 9 years. I have to admit I like a smaller lunch, so I usually get their egg drop soup to go. For $1.07 after tax it keeps me full until dinner! They give you a giant bag of fresh fried wonton strips with it, as well as a fortune cookie, and I always get a small side of siracha. I can't speak much of their regular lunches as soup is my norm, but I will say the kitchen the clean, the staff are friendly, and it always smells wonderful when I drop in"
"Always a hit with my family. We have never been disappointed at Mr. Wok. Hubby's favorite is Ton Chung, which he adores.The wok seared edamame is wonderful. The staff and Jack are just the best."
"One dish says it all, the Peking Duck. Quite possibly the best tasting duck in all of Dallas. They bring it out to you cooked and slice it up right in front of your eyes, a unique perspective. The meat was flavorful and the skin was extra crispy. Wrap it with the flour tortillas (I prefer the traditional white buns but they don't carry them), dab hoisin sauce and scallions and you're good to go. The remains on the duck you can have them create a soup or stir fry. Make sure you reserve the dish a day in advance because you will be mighty disappointed if you do not reserve and leave without duck in your stomach.The spicy Parmesan prawns were ehhh. 6-8 prawns on that big dish seemed kind of a rip off. The taste of the dish was not very unique in my opinion. I would of preferred to have the chili prawns instead. At least you could of mixed the sauce in with the rice.Service was pretty good. I will be back to tackle the Mango Shrimp next time. P.S. I saw about 6 flies buzzing around when I walked in so bring your own fly swatter just in case."
"Stealing a line from Seinfeld ""it's the best Jerry, the best.""  The owner (Jack) knows how to treat customers, the price is more than reasonable, and the food is outstanding no matter what you order.  This is our go to place when company visits."
"I've been twice and the food was good....love that it's BYOB.  The owner seems friendly and comes around to say hi and help out. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the service is a little slow.  Both times we had to flag the waitresses down for napkins/ to order/ get a wine opener, etc."
"I so want this place to be good after reading all the rave reviews and personal recommendation from friends.  Sadly, It was a complete let down.  I was there for lunch to scope the place out before taking the whole family there to feast one weekend.  The friendly waitress seated me quickly.  I ordered the Sichuan shrimp lunch special and opted for Hot and Sour soup.  After tasting the first spoon of the soup, I detected slight bitterness, maybe some of the ingredients were burnt?   Then I guess the MSG started to kick in and made the soup tasted smoother.  The Sichuan shrimp came with very small shrimps, I don't know, 200 counts?  Put one in my mouth and a slight fishy odor hit my scent - shrimps were not fresh!  I tried to pick off the vegies but the sauce was too sweet.  I paid and left looking for something to eat.  Ended up getting double cheese burger for lunch :(  I wondered how can the same people who make great Peking ducks that people raved about, be cooking crappy food like this?  They must have different chef doing the ducks?  I have a friend who owns a restaurant in Richardson and he uses second string chef to cook during lunch.Place is located in the part of town that could use more rennovation.  Service was friendly and efficient.I will definite not come back to this place for lunch, but still on the fence about coming back for the Peking duck since it is spoken so highly by my friends."
"This is a small restaurant and it can be a long wait depending on the time and day you go.  So far, the only thing I like about this place is their Peking duck with the white small buns and also a crispy tofu.  We had tried a few different items on the menu, but didn't like it.  The prices are reasonable and the services are friendly and fast."
"First of all, we decided to try this place because of all the wonderful reviews.We made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night. We weren't seated until close to 9pm.We were starving and the entire restaurant was packed to the gills and there wasn't even walking space. If someone called the Fire Department, they would have shut them down. It was so dangerous.When we finally got seated, it was another 30 minutes wait before anyone noticed that we hadn't been served. We tried to wave down serving staff, but it was just too packed.  It was like Black Friday shopping.Some folks, I guess regulars, helped themselves to plates and napkins.My first advice is unless you come for the Peking Duck, don't bother. Everything else is American Chinese. Go to your local Panda Express for their other dishes.The Peking Duck is very good.  Come here for that and don't come back for another 6 months because you will have a heart attack from all the fat and grease, if you have another one any sooner.A good sign of an authentic Chinese restaurant is by looking at the ratio of Asian diners vs non-Asian.  It was easily 80% non-Asian.I won't be coming back."
"We tried had the Peking duck with buns, green beans, crispy tofu, fried tilapia and chicken wings. It was worth the drive from Fort Worth! A must try."
"The Peking duck is one of the most amazing meals I've ever had. The meat is juicy and tender and balances perfectly with the scallions and hoisin sauce in their made-from-scratch pancakes. It's served in two courses, first as an entree, then as either a soup or stir fry. They split it for us and made both second courses. Both were amazing! The egg rolls are the best I've ever tasted and the wok seared edamame is a unique treat. Service is top notch, and the bill always seems like a bargain for the quality of the food and service."
"Jack from Mr Wok does a great Job!  Really good Chinese food - probably some of the best that I have had in the DFW area.  We had a duck - it was soooo good - the stir fry that accompanied it was great as well.  I really like that the duck is served with the traditional pancake to wrap it up in and not that spongy thing other places use.  The eggplant and garlic - YUM - the mango shrimp- YUM - the Fried rice - YUM and the green beans with pork YUM!   Nothing but really good things to say.  The cuts on the veggies were consistent, which made everything cook the same, the skill used to slice the pork was spot on - just like its done in China.  The Duck presentation is excellent!    Make a reservation!! This place gets packed!  The service is spot on- the wait staff does an excellent job!  Its BYOB - so do just do it!  I really liked visiting with Jack, he took the time to come out and visit with several of the tables - this is not something that you see often.  Can't wait to go back!"
This place is the best place I have found for Chinese Food in Plano.  Great food.
"Favorite fast casual Chinese restaurant in DFW. Get the duck, sesame chicken, crispy tangy beef, or fried calamari! The owner Jack is very personable as well. He takes time to talk to each table and makes everyone feel valued."
"Drove all the way out here to eat on recommendation of my cousin and his family. I agree with all the other reviewers...the Peking duck is AMAZEBALLS. Fresh and well marinated, cut at tableside. The skin is crispy and tasty, but not overcooked. The meat is flavorful and blends perfectly well with their freshly made plum sauce and cut scallion strips. The buns to wrap the Peking duck are soft, fresh and delightfully warm from the oven. I did not like the beggar's chicken as much as the duck, but it was tasty as well. The chicken is stewed in a giant bread bowl for 22 hours with sticky rice, giving the chicken meat a soft, melt-in-your-mouth almost bite and a sweet aftertaste from the rice. My uncle got the honors of cracking the bread bowl open too. We also ordered two vegetable dishes cooked with garlic sauce. The veggies were fresh and flavorful very well. Definitely go with some friends because the entrees are pretty big. The entrees are served family style. This place is delicious!"
"Great food and service. They really make the effort to accomodate since seating is really tight here. For those parties of 6 or more or those that preorder a Peking duck,you can make a reservation. Otherwise on a fri or sat be prepared to really wait unless you come in way before the rush...the one time I ordered a dish and not to my liking..they were most gracious in replacing it with something else. I always over order and glad to have leftovers to take home.  My only peeve is the tea pot...wish it was cleaned and shined..kind of greasy...and.  yes it is byob."
First visit was fantastic; friendly staff and Peking Duck was delicious. We will be back for sure!
"I had the curry noodle, and my husband had the sesame chicken. My husband was more pleased that I was...mine was just greasy and had a weird after taste. Hard to explain.I will say most people were ordering the Peking Duck...majority of the place...but I would need to go back and try with another couple. If I do I will gladly remove this post and post better. But as of now....meh!Oh...and always ackward to enter and not know if its ""wait to be seated"" or ""seat yourself""....and this was something that was a problem for others as well. Large photos of food are ok....but sign letting new people know what you expect in simple seating would be highly appreciated."
Unfortunately horrid- I've never spit out Chinese before now. I got sweet and sour chicken with fried rice- rice was hard and sauce for the chicken was awful. Chicken was the only remotely edible part and it was mostly breading.
Had an excellent meal tonight.  We were lucky enough to get duck (normally have to reserve at least a day in advance).  Also Mango Shrimp and my fav Spicy Chicken in Peanut Sauce.   Service is fast and friendly and food is consistently excellent.  We'be been coming here for at least 15 years.  Lots of regulars.  The table next to us ordered and impressive dish as well called Beggars Chicken...I think you have to call ahead a couple of days in advance  for that one too.  They don't take reservations for seating.  Don't deliver.  Do take phone orders for pickup.  Yummy to the nth degree.
"Food is awesome. Really relaxing place. Try their noodle soups (ramen), its super filling and not too expensive. Owner is a really cool guy too. I'm still waiting to try the duck. I've seen it served a few times when I was there and I really want to try it.Friend had the coconut chicken. I tried a bit of it, really really good. Big portions too.Would totally go again!"
"After reading several reviews we had to try out this place.  It was a Friday night around 8:30 and I decided to call to see if they have any extra peking duck since you have to preorder a day in advance.  Luckily they had one left and we were on our way. The restaurant is located in an area you wouldn't expect a restaurant to be located.  The place is small yet intriguing.  When we arrived the parking lot was almost full (1 spot left) I thought to myself, we must be destined to come here.  When we got through the door we waited about 5 minutes.  The restaurant was packed but somehow there was one table for 2 available.  This can't be happening!   Our last yelp outing, we waited 2 hours.We orderedPeking Duck, Mango Shrimp, and the Han fried rice. The fried rice looked a little greesy but is was good. The Mango shrimp was also good but our favorite was the Peking duck.  As the owner carved the duck it looked  very lean and succulent.  The owner asked us if we have been here before and we said no.  He told us that we had the choice of a 2nd course (left over from the duck) of duck soup or stir fried duck (my favorite).  The said he will do both since this is our first time here. (very nice of him to do that). Both dishes were good. We liked that they put clear noodles in the soup.  Back to the peking duck... : ) We also liked that they offer both the buns and tortillas and they weren't cheap on the sauce and scallions (nub that!).  We were pleased with the duck but wish the meat was a little more tender.  By far the best Peking duck in the Dfw area.My only complaint is they serves warm sodas from a can. By the time I poured my drink into the glass the ice has melted and it tasted flat and watery.  This won't stop me from coming back.  I'll just order water.The service was great.  The owner and our waitress were really nice.  It's  very rare to find this type of service in an Asain restaurant.We look forward to ordering the chicken beggar (pre-order 2 days) next time.Thanks to all the Yelpers for making our dining experience such a blast!"
Those giving rave reviews have obviously never tasted good Chinese food before. Had the mango shrimp which was edible but not spectacular. Someone needs to tell Mr. Wok dirty dishes should be taken to the kitchen not kept by the entrance. I question the health rating on this place.
"Ok this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in DFW and as good as the ones in NYC Chinatown. Peking duck is a must it must be ordered a day before , everything was great, also love that's it is BYOB they will even open your bottle and supply wine glasses. Only problem is its not that big and gets crowded quickly, so get a reservation and get there early and you still may need to wait but can wait with a glass of wine."
"Went there for the first time last night. Wow jammed pack with customers. Great food. We have appetizers, main course and everything was freshly made and wonderful."
"Don't let the exterior fool you! It looks like an old Pizza Inn or something. With a lovingly hand written sign on the door that says ""Entrance"". It came highly recommended and it's BYOB, which is important to us, since we are in the wine business. I was skeptical, because we are regulars at First Chinese BBQ, which I think is killer! The interior is cute and cozy. It's a small place and the place was packed! On a Wednesday! NOTE TO SELF...MAKE A RESERVATION IF i'M COMING AFTER 7PM.We ordered crab Rangoon and the house cinnamon egg rolls. They were good but not mind bowing great. But the entrees were mind blowing delicious! A few that were note worthy were: orange peel chicken, crispy tangy beef, and Singapore noodles.They were all delicious! I highly recommend the crispy tangy beef. It was like a beefy pork rind in sweet and spicy sauce. Sooooo yummy.  But everywhere I looked, diner after diner ordered the Peking Duck! Except for the diners next to us who ordered a beautiful whole, fried, and sauced red snapper to share! Hell Yea! I'm definitely ordering that next time!And the Peking Duck!The service was great. Friendly and attentive.And the bill was a pleasant surprise. Definitely going back."
"Been here about twice and loved it both times and since I am Asian, I think my reveiw ought to count for twice what the other ""white people's"" reviews are. But, thats just me.Ambience: Its an old Pizza Hut and you can tell they put a little bit of thought into the decor. It wasn't a let-put-up-some-pictures-of-the-mainland-and-call-it-a-day. There is a copious amount of red in the decoration but that's cool because they are asian. I personally expected a gold painted stone foo dog at my table with me. But I will settle for good food. Everything is clean. The bathrooms don't make me feel like I am going to come home with a STD. All good in my book.Food: Get the Peking Duck. You have to call a day in advance and they carve it at your table. I have had the leftovers done both ways: fried and in soup. And I have to say I prefer the soup because then you are are not picking up weird, unrecognizable duck parts hoping you are not eating something that you normally wouldn't touch with a nine-foot-pole let alone put in your mouth. I mean, I am just sayin'. You should eat everything family style and completely over order because everything here is good. I like their Eggplants (that taste like beef - not everything has to taste like chicken), their calamari for appetizers, their curry isn't bad. But why would you order curry at an chinese restaurant? Their noodles are pretty awesome.Service: Thankfully they are not a completely asian-fied restaurant which means their servers don't come by, throw the menus at you and go ""whatchu want?"". The owner came by to make sure everything was dandy. No complains on this front.Personally, if you want some chinese food, you can't really go wrong with Mr Wok's. They have been gently Americanized so they are stuff that you normally won't see at the normal chinese mom and pop places and the prices are reasonable. You should grab some friends and order up some duck."
"Known for their crispy skin Peking duck but I also enjoy the fact that they bring out the duck and slice it super thin for you at table side. It's an experience! Other highlights include great service of friendly English speaking wait staff, clean place, fusion menu, and BYOB ( they have wine glasses, no corking fees, no drinking wine out of Chinese tea cups either) :)"
2 dishes:Peking DuckMango  Shrimp.Hands down. We love this place!
"I recently phoned in an order for some Mr Wok takeout, and I'm sad to say that the food was atrocious.  The service was pretty good, though.  Prompt and correct order taking, along with a quick follow-up when one of the noodle dishes was out.  Definitely can't do any better with customer support.  I just wish the food was just as good. Perhaps it was an off-night for the restaurant, but all of the food ordered (combination fried rice, pot stickers, chow fun, egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, etc.) seemed to be missing the following key characteristics: pleasant aroma, flavor, texture.  [I'll concede on the texture part, as this was take-out, and the containers usually don't keep crunchy noodles or fried foods crisp.]However, all of the food sampled had a strong pungent odor that smelled a bit like week-old chicken or dish cleaner.  The food tasted a bit consistent with the odor, and (while certain whiffs did remind my nose that this is Chinese food) made me a bit fearful that this sampling might run a number on my system.All the same, the search for a great Chinese restaurant in Plano keeps turning up some pretty poor results.  I have hopes that one day there'll be a restaurant which consistently delivers great quality Chinese food."
"Make reservations and call in advance if you want Peking duck.  We were lucky and they happened to have a few extra and we were able to call in on a Friday night and still come and get the Peking duck.  You can also opt to get the steamed buns (like gua bao buns) instead of the thin pancakes but they want you to order that over the phone in advance as well--they almost got angry with us for not asking for the buns over the phone.  The duck is delicious--it's lean and crispy and tender.  The buns are great with them and they are very generous with the portions of green onions and sauce.  The Peking duck is given to you in two courses--one with the meat and the other to make use of the bones: either stir-fried or in soup.  We tried the stir-fry which is basically the bones with the rest of the meat not carved on fried with Chinese salty pickled vegetables and a bunch of soy sauce.  It's flavorful but it was way too salty for my liking.  I wouldn't recommend it and next time, we'd choose the soup.  For $32, a whole fresh duck in two courses is a steal.We also ordered the mango shrimp as recommended by the other Yelpers.  It was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  For $12 you get a good portion of mango and about 8 fried shrimp in a small crispy wonton shell.  Cool concept but not worth it.To finish off the meal, we shared one order of sauteed green beans (only $6) but they really only give you $6 worth. It was a tiny tiny portion.  Barely enough to share for four people.  They were flavorful though...definitely not skimping on the garlic!  We also got the beef chow foon--pretty standard--but, we needed something to feed the toddler!The food is pretty standard except for, of course, the Peking duck.  The Beggar's Chicken also looks extremely intriguing and the smells coming from the one ordered across the room gave me some food envy.  I definitely want to try it next time I'm in Dallas.  But, they do require 48-hour notice.  (Pretty much, when you call to make a reservation, they want you to be able to order your entire meal. ;) )The space is crowded and not designed for the claustrophobic.  The atmosphere is hectic: huge parties crowd around round tables in the center, drinking wine (the restaurant is BYOB) and laughing, and then lots of parties of 2 to 4 lining the walls in booths designed to fit 1.5 people. Literally.  The restaurant is a bit dirty too--the windows by each of the booth tables have piles of dust that have seemed to accumulate over years of time and the curtains are distracting and dusty as well.  Definitely needs some more attention to detail in the cleaning department."
This place is awesome. Great variety of dishes and have had a great meal every time. Not greasy like other places and not too pricey. Great authentic Asian food!
"This place was ok. It failed a couple of my benchmarks that typically indicate a good Asian establishment (they accept credit cards, had no visible Buda statue at the front door and I also saw mostly Americans patrons). But the food was good. American-Asian I would call it, not Asian-Asian which is my typical preference.We followed the Yelp suggestions and had the Tangy/spicy beef. Not overly breaded and had crisp, fresh veggies.I was disappointed, however, they didn't have any thai peppers to make my dish spicy...I'm still trying to figure that one out...but it was a decent meal on the whole. One of the members of our party got the lettuce wraps and reported much satisfaction.The menu was extensive, lots to pick from.The service was fast and the server was friendly enough. She even came back to refill our teas twice, before it was essential. We plan on going back cause the Peking Duck looked AWESOME!! Something that needs to be called ahead.As I sat there, I re-read the Yelp reviews and I didn't see any black stuff coming out of the air returns. I didn't see any indication of an unclean establishment either."
"Food quality: Food quality is pretty good. I sampled mostly every type of dish (our table was a foodie crowd) from rices, soups, noodles, entrees, appetizers, salads and signature dishes. Rice dishes are colorful and contain many ingredients, but the rice grain is bland and not flavorful, a little soy sauce easily fixes this. The lo-mein had very thick noodles and the dish was a tad on the greasy side, but still flavorful. The ""orange chicken"" style entree was good, although the sauce was a bit too sweet and the breading (batter) on the chicken is too thick. The vegetable dishes I tried were all super good and fresh and looked spectacular. My table ordered the Peking Duck, the apparent ""hype"" plate of the restaurant and it did not fulfill my expectations. I was really looking forward to the duck, given the apparent hype around the plate and all the reviews that comment on how good it is, but it really is not that spectacular. Do not get me wrong, the dish is pretty good, but the amount of meat that the duck gives when carved is very little and some skin flakes are crunchy, others are soggy and too greasy. We chose to have our duck leftovers done in a soup (you can choose between soup or stir-fry) and the soup was very greasy, hard to eat (sifting through bones) and lacked substance. The table carving aspect of the dish has so much potential, but the way they carved it for us was neither impressive nor fun.Food presentation: Food presentation is pretty. What you expect from any good, Chinese restaurant. The style of presentation is communal, so plates are big and meant to share.Appearance of restaurant: Restaurant is a definite ""hole in the wall"" but the food quality is way above their looks. It has a nice comfy, authentic feel to it. It can get a bit crowded though on busy nights. Cleanliness can be greatly improved (small details and not overall hygiene).Service: Service is good. Nothing too spectacular. I do not have any complaints or praises.Value: This is where this place absolutely rocks. This is definitely a place to go with a small group. Expect to pay less than $15 per person to literally stuff your face with delicious and authentic food.In general: This is a pretty neat place to go with a small group to try authentic Chinese food. Value is amazingly good and the food will not disappoint. Sure, they could improve some things, but you will leave satisfied when you take into consideration the whole experience and not some minor details that realistically speaking restaurants of this caliber are not expected to fulfill.Note: This review is based on my years of professional experience in the food and restaurant business and reflects my personal opinion."
"Tried this place after seeing it being rated among D Magazine's Top 100 for 2013. I seriously doubt D Magazine's competency now after a lunch trip here.As other reviewers before have written, the place is a flashier version of Panda Express. The food is Americanized to the core, in flavor and spice. Don't expect anything authentic here. The Szechwan Peppercorn Chicken was bland, spice-less (after ordering extra spicy) and flavorless. The accompanying cup of fried rice was worse: dry & stale.I am not a Chinese but have eaten better authentic Chinese food around."
"I can't say much for other dishes but the peking duck here is awesome! I went to Mr. Wok with my friend for a lunch date and we decided, why not get peking duck?! The presentation was great, the waitress brought the whole duck out and carved it in front of us, and then they used what was left to make a soup. Honestly, the soup was a bit bland and I didn't care too much for it but the buns and duck were MMM delish!"
"Ate here this weekend with the hubby on the recommendation of a non-yelper friend whose food advice I trust :)  It had never particularly stood out on Yelp to me before but they deserve some more lovin'!We were actually on our way to try out Lion City when we remembered this place--I called to see if they had any extra Peking ducks available and even though they were pretty busy, they were able to accomodate us and put us on the list (even though reservations are for 6 people + according the sign we saw when we arrived).  The girl on the phone warned us it would be 15-20 minutes wait, but we didn't mind since we hadn't even thought enough ahead to reserve a duck!  We were seated in about 10 minutes, and got straight to the duck-ordering.  Service from everyone we interacted with was very friendly, and we especially liked that it's the owner who carves the duck tableside for you and makes conversation.  Now I have to say I am somewhat spoiled because the first time I had Peking Duck was on our honeymoon--we went to China and while in Beijing we went to the place that invented it.  Now THAT was an amazing meal.  I can't say Mr. Wok (or any other place we've tried since) quite measures up but I really liked it and we'll definitely be back to get it again.  And I will also say it was better than the supposed best place in Houston Chinatown (which is generally superior to the places in Dallas Chinatown).  The duck carved for us was fairly lean but very juicy.  Quite a bit of it was left on the bones, but it worked out well because we decided to try the stir-fry of the remaining duck pieces/bones instead of the soup for the second course because we had never tried it that way before.   The stir fry wasn't as tasty as the traditional duck preparation, but it was interesting and we were glad we tried it.  I will also second whoever else I saw commented that the crepes were basically tortillas, which detracts from the experience just a tad, but I think you can order steamed buns instead so we'll check that out next time.   The skin was nice and crispy but it wasn't as razor thin as it should be and still had a kinda thick layer of fat underneath.  Still tasted delicious but wasn't as crispy that way.  My only REAL complaint about the experience was that I had been vacillating back and forth about whether I wanted to splurge on dessert and had finally gotten pumped up about the fried banana eggrolls but our waiter brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  I know dessert is not typical in traditional Chinese restaurants and I'm sure I could have asked for it, but I took it as a sign that I didn't need the dessert, especially after 2 weeks of a food-filled vacation.  I'll get it next time :)So yeah...basically...go here.  We will actually call ahead next time because we want to try out the Beggar's chicken, and they request 2 days notice for that one."
"I have mixed feelings about this place.  The first few times we came, we really liked it.  But the last time we were there for Chinese New Year, it was a horrible night for both the restaurant and us.  They normally do not take reservations for 2 but since I was pre-ordering a lot of food, they accommodated us.  The place was packed and one table was complaining that they have been there for 2 hours and still haven't gotten all their food. So we were forewarn that it was going to be a long night. It did take 2 hours to finish our meal also. The waiter was very sorry each time he came by, we were like no problem.  I had pre-ordered the lobsters.  They were expensive and not good.  I was very disappointed.  They spilled HOT soup on us accidentally. Only got an apology, did not get comp or offer to dry clean our clothes.On other occasions, we had their peking duck and they were good. You have to pre-order and if you want steam buns, make sure you tell them when you call. The owner explained to us that they are specially flown in from NY and very lean.  The Beggar chicken was difficult to eat.  We didn't know we had to stir the dish well.  We ate from top down and it did not have much flavor at the top.  The family style tofu was really good, but it seems it is inconsistent.  Another time we came for the tofu and it was totally different than before.  The pork belly with preserved veg was good.  The place is very small.  It is best to go when they are not busy or holiday time.  From the outside, it looks like it used to be a pizza place.  Anyways you come here for the food, not the atmosphere."
"Whole Snapper - do yourself a favor and try it next time, the sauce concoction was mind boggling-ly good! The chef here is a genius, can't wait to try their Peking duck - this place is a hidden find, love their ambience too."
"Good decent Chinese good.  A tad greasy, but that's Chinese for ya.  It's the reason why my face is always oily...damn me for the things I eat! Didn't get a chance to order their special Peking duck but will def be back to get my grub on!"
Other than the Peking duck and some appetizers i didn't really eat anything else here and I have been here 3 times so far. The Peking duck itself is enough to make me want to come back again and again. :) It is really delicious. You can get either tortillas or steamed buns with the duck but personally  I think steamed buns is a better choice. I would advise to call them in advance for the duck.  It's a great place for big groups of people. The customer service is great and don't forget its a BYOB.
"We had a reservation at 12pm but we wait for another 1 hour and 15 mins to get our table. The lady sliced 80% of the duck to the table cloth and pick them up to the plate. When we  asked her to be careful, she stopped slicing and put the half empty plate to our table. We though the left duck will be stired fried and served us anyway but we were wrong. It came again with half empty plate for stir fried. How we know it? Everyone ordered duck that day and we have eyes. Service is awful there. I will not go."
Love this place. Great food great service and it's byob. Jack the owner is always  friendly  and cooks a great duck.
"The Peking duck is simply incredible. Haven't had the opportunity to try any other dishes, but definitely worth the trip....."
"Bland flavors. Woo point try again,  prefer to go to Psnda's to get something similar but with better taste . So go figure."
Guys...this place a diamond in the rough! Had my bday here with a party of 15. It was a first time for all of them and they ALL walked out impressed!Peking Duck (request the buns....it taste better)Mango ChickenBeggars ChickenThose are a definite must. Believe Jack's the owner. Pretty nice guy....even took a shot with us!BYOB as well
"Awful!  I don't think I've ever eaten such bland Chinese before.  Orange chicken not orangy nor spicy,  just a sweet ish generic taste with no depth.  Bell pepper beef,  no taste at all.  Lo mein, bland and oily. No taste no taste no taste.  Fried Rice tasted kind of burned.  How can you screw up fried rice? ?? Had great expectations about this place.  Alas,  no luck.  Not coming back.  Ever."
Awesome food!  Wait can be long but that's probably due to their great food.  Loved the Peking duck.  Try to get the guy to carve it instead of the lady.  The guy seemed to be much more skilled.  Everything we tried was good or great.  Definitely go for the Peking duck.  Make sure you call ahead since it's very popular.
"I've only been there twice for lunch with a group of folks and both times it was specifically for Peking Duck. But it was phenomenal. Each time I sort of wished we had left a few of them at the office so I could have a bigger portion. We ordered the bok choy as a side dish and it was great too. Attentive, professional service."
"I've been to Mr Wok a number of times in the past several months; most recently with my brother and girl friend over the holidays. I wanted to go to a place that was not stuffy, and was fun, as well as a great dining experience. To date, Mr Wok has not let me down, and all of the people that I've taken rave about the food, staff, and owers.Mr Wok has always been a great place to go with hordes of people. Of course I love BYOB venues, where I can bring lots of wine. I have a more detailed review on my blog, danesemeats.com/?p=468, but suffice it to say, I have always enjoyed most everything I've eaten there."
"Don't let the building turn you away. It's a hole in the wall for sure buy I was surprised by this place! The food is really good, and you get a ton for what you pay. It's really hard to find good egg foo young, but this place has it! We ordered food to go and it was ready in 15 minutes! Try the egg foo young and the combination lo mein, delish! Pork egg rolls are good and the crab Rangoon were fried to perfection. Definitely will be ordering from here again."
Yelper's Please Listen: This Place Sucks!!! I'm not a hater either.  Drove from Dallas to Plano to check this place out and what a horrible decision.  The duck was bland. I agree with everyone the duck is hot and fresh but it's flavorless. C'mon people 5 to 4 stars. The Chinese food is just as bad as the duck. I rather eat mall Chinese food. One waiter and one cashier = slow service! You will thank me later.
"Despite all the good review for their Peking duck, I was disappointed after my first and most likely ONLY visit.  Maybe I have high expectation for my favor dish, the Peking duck, since I did grow up in Beijing and weekly Peking duck is a norm for me.  If you never tasted authentic Peking duck, then the duck here IS pretty good.  For people out there who are seeking the real Peking duck, you probably will be disappointed like me.  If you really want to taste some pretty good Peking duck without going to China, in Houston there is a restaurant at the corner of Gessner and hwy 95, call Peking Cuisine (go figure).  Ducks there is very close to true Peking duck, sometimes order ahead is preferred.  My last visit, I think the dish was $35, which came with duck and soup.  Mr. Wok's duck soup is just so wrong.  Soup supposes to be white color (a very long cooking process that turns a clear soup to white soup).  Here is what a true Peking duck should be like (if you don't agree with me, then maybe you shouldn't try the Houston place).1. Traditional Peking ducks are very fatty, dripped with oil once it is cooked.  That is only because the methodology raising the ducks is very different.  Those ducks in China are called stuffed duck.  Each and everyday, instead of self feeding, people actually grab the ducks by the head and push a tube filled with food into the duck mouth and force the food down, making the duck very fat.  Now days, the fat ducks are not less popular, so leaner ducks are an option on the menu.  2. The wrapper should be paper thin, because its only purpose is to hold the duck, the sauce and the onion.  Steam bun or tortillas is actually not ideal.  Steamed bun is only preferred by southern and I never saw eating ducks like that until I come to America.  I use tortillas at home only because I don't know how to make paper thin wrappers.  Both over powering the taste of the duck.  The Houston restaurant has good wrapper.3. The black sauce should be sweet and the onion is typically white part only.  Both are used to cover or overcome the greasiness of the duck."
"Full disclosure alert. I was taken here by my friend Dave Gilbert, ex of Luqa and Lazare and fellow cooking conspirator. He knows the owners and suggested that I join him one evening for Peking Duck.It was damn good. The skin was perfect. The pancakes were a bit of a let down, though. They actually seemed more like tortillas than delicate pancakes.We, of course, had the soup made from the duck bones at the end - delicious too. terrific spicy eggplant, really good fish/tofu. rice bowls and I could have been in HK.The place doesn't have a license, so green tea was the drink of choice.As one might imagine, the service was impeccable, and the owner spent considerable time visiting - and even though Dave is a good friend of his, I didn't feel in the least left out.Great stuff.Oh if you are going to order the Peking Duck, do it a day or so in advance. It takes a while to make one of those suckers."
"I wasnt expecting to eat much because we had just had tokyo one for lunch, but as the food kept coming, I really couldnt stop. They boast of an updated interpretation of traditional chinese food, and they really do satisfy the taste buds of chinese-food purists like my parents. Peking duck- They carve a whole duck in front of your table. The skin is crispy and the duck is juicy. It comes with all the traditional condiments except their wrap is actually flour tortillas. Its definitely worth the $30 and its definitely a highlight.Mango shrimp- The shrimp and mango sit inside a crispy wonton bowl. There wasnt enough shrimp but the mango pieces made up for it. They were sweet, fresh, and was a good counterpart to the creamy sauce. Chicken soup- I think this is another one you have to order in advance and I'm not sure if its even on the menu. It comes in a big clay pot and they simmer the chicken for so long that the soup becomes milky. There are bits of ham for more flavor and lotus ""nuts""?. There were 6 of us and we still brought home 2 soup to-go containers full so this feeds a lot. The flavor of the soup was so robust and hearty. We usually dont eat very salty foods at home, so we asked for a cup of hot water to dilute. The waitress came back with the cup and also took a little sample back for the chef to taste so you definitely know they are really concerned about customer satisfaction and serious about controlling the quality of their food. I was really impressed!Do not be deterred by the pizza hut ambiance!!!"
"Vegetarians and vegans rejoice! There are so many choices on the menu, you'll have to take your time perusing them all.The peanut sauce that comes with the crispy tofu is good enough to involve espionage to figure out the recipe.A delightful establishment suitable for a quick lunch or a fancy dinner."
"Poor service (crammed parties of 8 and another of 7 with reservations) into side booths with a small end table despite 2 large round tables being available. One hour later a party of 7 (5 adults and 2 small kids - similar composition as the other parties) was placed in one of the large round tables. When asked, the usher replied ""I don't assign the tables"". For large parties, the table remains crowded with empty platters as the service personnels do not automatically clear them away. Service personnels do not refill empty water glasses. Overall one star for poor service.Setting is a converted ex-Pizza Hut building. Minimal decor inside and tables are crowded together. Overall one and a half stars for below average setting/decor.The Peking duck is on par with one of the street side vendors in Flushing, NY. Other dishes tried (mango shrimp, fried whole fish, tofu with fish, and shrimp noodle) are on par with the cheaper restaurants in Los Angeles, CA. Not on par with the better restaurants in the Orient, New York, or California. Overall three star for food quality (average)."
Peking duck!!!My family loves this place.Awesome service and food. Peking duck slicing & beggar's chicken service is somewhat of a show case and highly recommend bringing any visitors from out of town for a dining experience.Be sure to make reservations at least a day or two ahead as it says here for peking duck and beggar's chicken.Mango shrimp is awesome too.
"Mr. Wok is a gem in East Plano.  Must try the Peking duck (order a day in advance to ensure you get one) and mango shrimp.  Their duck doesn't have a thick layer of fat like other Chinese restaurants.  I also like lettuce cool wraps, cold noodles, general's chicken, calamari, edamame.  Everything is good on their menu.  Satisfies both authentic and westernized Chinese/Japanese dishes.  Prices are very reasonable.  BYOB.  Great service.  Worth a try!"
"Definitely a word of mouth sort of place. It's located in a somewhat run-down area in east Plano, and other then the parking lot being full on the weekend, you would never guess that this Chinese restaurant is one of the best in DFW.Like the other reviewers say, the Peking Duck, Beggars Chicken, and Mango Shrimp are excellent. Everything else we ordered was good but not exceptional.The service at many Chinese restaurants can be terrible when busy due to being understaffed. However, I counted 7 employees on our visit to Mr. Wok on a very crowded Friday night which is a lot considering this place is so tiny. The four servers were great. Our party of 10 (along with two other large parties) kept them quite busy but they were very helpful and happy to make us feel at home. The owner is also a very cheerful, social guy who frequently talked to the diners to make sure everything was great. You can really tell that the workers here are very eager to satisfy their customers.And it's BYOB, so bring your friends and family along with a bottle or ten of spirits!"
"Found Mr. Wok online and decided to go. Tried to make reservations for 2 but unless ordering Peking Duck, Beggers Chicken, or have a party of at lest 6 reservations not possible. Took a chance and went anyway and no tables available so the staff brought in a table for us. Mr Wok seems to be king of Peking Duck as we saw at least 8 served in the hour we were there. We ordered tangy crispy beef and shrimp in garlic and sweet chili and both were amazing. Staff was great and attentive. Highly recommend."
Great People .... Great food.... and BYOB!  My typical order.....Edaname....Peking Duck... (pre-ordered) Salt and Pepper Squid...All 3 are great and plenty for a family of 4.Jack takes pride in his family history of great food and his wife helps take care of customer service as well.  Lets put it this way.  We drive out from Arlington to Plano to eat duck.  Enuf said.
"My family and I love this place! But there are some secrets here that i am going to share with you, bc I love you. There are 3 things on the menu that you have to order 24 hours in advance: 1. Beggars Chicken- the presentation for this dish is unbelievable, i have never seen anything like it. This is a chicken that is wrapped in banana leaves and stuffed with 5 spice sticky rice and then covered in a dough and cooked for a whole day to preserve the flavor. The whole restaurant stops to watch as a huge ( like 20 pound) mound of dough is brought out to the table. The servers will let the people at the table attempt to crack the dough. After cutting open the dough and unwrapping the banana leaves, the chicken is finally presented. It is moist and flavorful. This is not my favorite dish, personally, I am not a fan of 5 spice. 2. Peking Duck- this too had to be ordered a day in advance, but they usually have some extras on the weekend. They start roasting the duck as soon as you get there and then they bring it out and carve it right at your table. It is served with ""pancakes"", scallion strips, and plum sauce. Amazing. You can then choose to have a soup made with the bones or a stir fry. The stir fry is the way to go. 3. Red Snapper- again, call ahead. I haven't had this one yet, I will def get it next time. More to come on that. The price is right, the staff is friendly, and the owner carves your duck or chicken at your table. I love me some Mr. Wok!!!!"
service was good. I thought the yaki soba sounded good the waitress said it was and she was right.  a nice place and I am picky
"I've had the pleasure of eating at Mr. Wok twice now and both times have been great.  For starters, the staff has always been friendly, welcoming, and attentive.The food selection at Mr. Wok is extensive.  They have a host of typical Chinese dishes as well as a few house specialties that you likely won't find anywhere else.  The Peking duck is very good and reasonably priced, though you have to plan in advance and order 1 day ahead.  I would have to recommend the wok-seared edamame each time you go -- it's inexpensive and absolutely incredible.  Other dishes I've tried are also very good, but these have stood apart from the rest.It's nice to find an independently owned stand-out restaurant in a sea of wannabes.  Give Mr. Wok a shot if you're looking for great Chinese food in a friendly, casual environment.  And it's BYOB, which helps keep the cost down if you plan to drink."
"Mr. Wok has become my family's new favorite go-to place for Peking Duck.  (I believe my parents go AT LEAST once a month)  My Mom was a little disappointed that Jack (the owner) forgot who they were as they were frequent visitors, but they were still glad he was there as they claim he is the best person to have for slicing up the duck!   We ordered the preserved vegetable beef (my mouth is still watering), the tofu & salted fish (okay) and the Kung Pao Squid (good, but my parents thought it tasted more ""western"" than asian)  The REAL reason they come is for the duck!  (you need to call in advance to make sure they have it and to reserve your own!) The peking duck is delicious!!!  They slice it thin and the skin is so crispy and full of flavor!  You eat it with hoisin sauce, tons of thin flour 'tortillas' and spring onions.  Mmmmmm....  The best part comes afterwards where you have the choice of eating the remainder of the duck in soup or stir fried with even more preserved vegetables, garlic and spices!  (we chose the latter)  The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and Jack is quite personable as well.  (my Mother adores him!)  The atmosphere is somewhat asian (I have a suspicion that it may have been a pizza hut in its former life) but still comfortable.  I'll definitely be back with parents and friends for more Peking Duck!!!"
"Long wait but the food is worth it!  I only get the Peking Duck here since it's the best in Dallas.  It can get a little noisy and crowded at times but once you take the first bite, nothing else matters.  I make my own special sauce that compliments the duck and bring it with me along with some beers and I'm set!!"
"This place sucks. Ordered tonkotsu ramen and mabo ramen. Not good. It's insulting that they can make this and call it tonkotsu broth flavor. Also ordered the gyoza, as a starter as stated in the menu, it came out last after we finished the ramen. The bill even came before the gyoza. Please do yourself a favor and don't come here.reply to jack:If its considered Yokohama-style, then why don't you write Yokohama-style and not tonkotsu.  FYI: it's pretty important.  I don't think a french restaurant would write ""foie gras"" and give customers a plate of bullshit.  If your ramen noodles are fresh, then why is it imported from Japan.  I think fresh usually means its made by hand for daily use. And thanks for apologizing for the sh*tty service for the gyoza. HIGH FIVE!"
"Mr Wok has an impressive menu of various Asian dishes.  This isn't a Chinese food restaurant, it's an Asian bistro, with many Asian countries represented on the menu.  My favorite is the Cha Han, a delicious, addicting rice dish.  My wife orders it every time. They don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own.  Mr Wok doesn't have high turnover amongst the wait staff, so they are educated regarding the menu, if you have questions.  I'd suggest this bistro to anyone who appreciates quality Asian food, and people whom like to try new things."
"I am writing this review to comment on their policy for reservations.  Unless you have a party of six or more or you order their specials Peking duck or beggar's chicken, you will not be able to make a reservation. So if you have a small group and you don't want to eat the specials then don't bother coming during peak hours.   We went here on a Saturday night for two without reservation and we saw all parties without reservation basically left.  One regular customer even confirm the difficulty of getting a table here.  But we thought we could tough it out as we already drove thirty miles to get to this restaurant.  After a forty five minutes wait, we were told that our table was getting cleaned.   But then once it was ready, they gave it to a party of six with reservation, and all these people were squeezed into a booth designed for four.   While the food did look good, we thought their reservation system absolutely sucked.  They should do a first come first serve or take reservations for all.  There are plenty of other authentic Chinese food in Richardson so won't bother to go back."
"Introduced Mr. Wok to yet another set of friends and once again it was a huge hit.  Peking duck was delicious as usual, but also fabulous tonight was the whole friend snapper and the Cantonese crispy noodles."
"If you like Peking duck, then you'll love Mr Wok!  Being originally from Houston where you can readily get bonafide Peking duck, I was skeptical about trying this place out.  I'm glad I did though because it didn't disappoint. They carved the duck in front of us and then gave us a choice of stir frying the meaty bones or making soup with them (do the stir fry, it's pretty darn good).  Legit establishment with a very friendly staff in a cozy atmosphere."
"So after hearing about this place and read the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  What a disappointment!  The Peking duck is very bland. Tasted more like boiled duck.  The tangy beef was way too saucy and not even crispy like the description.   Don't know whether because they are short on staff but service is super slow.  I would not recommend this place.  If you like Peking duck, go try tasty china in garland, much better!!!"
"I have to admit that I was a bit surprised . Walking up to the restaurant , it looked like an old run-down Pizza Hut .  And the parking lot is horrendous .  And inside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall , but once the food came out I was amazed .  We shared three orders of Peking duck ( which you have to pre-order 24-hour in advanced ), 2 orders of mango shrimp , beggars chicken  and lots more .  What's also great is that it's BYOB !  I was a bit surprised at the appetizer sampler .  The appetizers looked like something you would find at any fast food Chinese restaurant .  But overall I liked this place a lot .  Definitely something I would bring my parent to !"
"I love Peking Duck and this restaurant in Dallas is the closest we've come to find that offers authentic PD style ducks in north Texas.  Most of the other Chinese restaurants hasn't come close here at all but Mr Wok nailed it for us after years of searching.  After the duck is stripped of meat, you get a choice of either soup or stirfry from the leftover bones - nothing wasted.  I prefer the stir fry bones just so I can chew on the leftover bones.  We'd give it five stars if it's just the ducks but unfortunately other dishes kind of miss the mark.  If you want Peking duck then this is it - five quacks.  Other dishes are meh (tried the fish and the beggar's chicken and a couple others, passable but nothing great that stood out).  You do have to plan for the duck and order and reserve your seat a day in advance.  Oh and bring a good bottle of wine as it's BYOB."
The pecking duck and beggars chicken is the best their. The pecking duck is the first course and then you get an option of soup and something else with. The beggars chicken is magnificent but you have to order it 3 days before!!
Had dinner with the family tonight - tried both their Peking Duck and Beggar's chicken after all the raves from family/friends.I was a bit underwhelmed (maybe i was oversold and had high expectations).  The Peking Duck was good - crispy skin and not fatty!  The Beggar's chicken was a bit of a disappointment.  The flavor was a bit too herbal and the chicken seemed overcooked.Had a few other dishes:  mango shrimp - nice pieces of mangos and good flavor;  eggplant with garlic - ok..I guess you can't go wrong with eggplant;  pork with tofu & jalepenos and crispy tangy beef - forgettable.
"Being from NYC,  I am used to great Chinese food.  Unfortunately this place is not one of them.  The noodle soup was utterly disgusting - soggy noodles and soup with absolutely no flavor. My wife is Japanese and even she couldn't stomach not than 2 bites.  Also tried the Moo Shu pork which was not good.  The only OK dish was the Chinese green vegetables.Trust me,  anyone that knows real food from the coasts will want your money back.  Come if you want to be ripped off."
"One peking duck served 12 of us, and we ordered 3 of them.  I ate 5 servings myself.  My wife told me just because everyone else doesn't eat at lightning speed like me, doesn't mean they aren't planning to eat more.  Hey, you snooze, you lose.  Best peking duck and BYOB.  We will be back."
"Dallas's best peking duck.  While the peking duck is awesome, everything does not seem to be authentic Chinese.  Kinda weird the the peking duck is made authentically but not the other dishes I've tried.  But I have to say I have only tried about five other dishes.  I have tried what seems to be the second best dish there which appears to be the chicken in this big whote enclosure that they let you smash.  The Peking Duck alone makes it 4 star if you love peking duck!!!"
"Second visit to-go this time.  My son had a hankering for ramen and he wanted to try the miso ramen.  Soup is deconstructed to-go and you get to put it together when you get home.  All ingridients were very fresh.  Noodles were excellent, my boy gave it a 7 out of ten - way better than deep-fried grocery store purchased noodles. Fried banana spring rolls were a hit again...we'll be back"
"Quite inexpensive for a place I didn't think was all that great.  It's a little better than your run of the mill chinese joint pushing General Tso's chicken, but not worth the extra imho.  Try a Vietnamese joint or something more interesting next time you want Asian, there's plenty around (surprisingly cosmopolitan) Greater Dallas."
"I have eaten here 3 times.  I really wanted to like it because it is a mom and pop place not a chain and it is close to my house.  The food is ok, the service is ok, but the place is DIRTY!  They really need to remodel - there is filth everywhere.  Don't look at the air vents in the ceiling - there is black stuff hanging out of them.  The bathroom fixtures have dirt embedded in the grout and caulk.  It is too dirty to clean - just need to paint, tear out the fixtures, and start over."
"I love the Duck!  It's not like most places where it comes with a thick layer of fat below the skin.  They cook it a special way so that the fat is melted off during the process, leaving a crispy skin and juicy meat!  I really enjoyed eating it with the sticky buns and making mini duck sandwiches out of them!  But definitely order the buns first!  It takes a while for them to bring it out.  They will ask you how you would like the leftover bones cooked after they finish carving it.  You can either get them stir fried or made into soup.  I've only tried the stir fry so far and was very happy with my choice.  It makes great leftovers as well!  We also ordered the Mango Shrimp which was ok.  I thought it was a bit too sweet but it was still tasty.  I would recommend trying to go with a group of 3 or more if you get the Duck or Beggar's Chicken.  It's a lot of food.  If not, go anyways and take leftovers home with you!!"
"Never write reviews, but this place is a little gem that is mainly known through word of mouth so wanted to share.   Was not a Peking duck fan until a friend insisted I try it here.  I've since tried duck all over town and hands down, Mr. Wok is the best.  Golden crispy skin, no fat, and succulent meat carved tableside.  Be sure to pre-order duck or you won't get any. It's a fun, lively, casual little place in an old Pizza Hut building.  Nothing fancy, just really good food.  Its been a big hit with all the friends and family we've brought too.  Service is friendly and personal -- you feel like family.  BYOB so bring your favorite booze."
"If you want the freshest peking duck.. you gotta come here... you wanna have a little fun.. you gotta get the beggars chicken.  the food is superb. You get a fresh duck carved in front of you, then either stir fried or made into a soup.  The mango shrimp is to die for! All in all, great fresh food for a great price! make sure if u want the peking duck to order 24hrs in advance. the beggars chicken must be preordered 48 hours in advance. they slow cook it with stuffed with sticky rice in banana leaf for 22 hours!  The owner, Jack also serves you and a really nice guy!"
"Save yourself a trip if you're here for authentic Chinese food and the Peking duck. The ""Chinese food"" served here is beyond Americanized, even compared to Panda Express. But hey, we are in the U.S. so that's totally understandable. Now onto the duck, it was a major disappointment because if this is the best duck we've got in Dallas, then I guess I might as well crossing Peking duck off my to-eat list going forward. All dishes I've tried ( 2 separate trips with over 10+ dishes ordered) are all on the overly salty and sweet side, and they just taste like they have the same base sauce no matter what you order. I would have given the place a non-star as a Chinese restaurant, but judging from its patron group it seems like its flavor suits the American taste buds hence the 2 stars."
"Our waitress was okay, but honestly that is normal for any Chinese restaurant. I grew up eating at the same chinese restaurant  for 30 years. I moved to texas a couple of years ago and haven't bothered to look for a replacement...Chinese food is not a hot item out here. So glad i came here for the Peking Duck.  I love Duck and this did not disappoint.  Perfect crispy skin and super tender meat.  The the stir fried pieces were awesome.  The prices were sinfully low, usually i paid twice this much in Los Angeles for great Chinese food. BYOB saves you another 25% on your bill. The guy that runs the place was super nice.  The decor is lacking and there are a lot of large loud families, but i am still looking forward to going back.  The only people that should be questioning the authenticity should be from china. I am from the san gabriel valley which is 75% asian, and this was pretty darn good."
You've never had Peking Duck until you've been to Mr. Wok. They only use the best duck and the skin is cooked to that tasty crispy perfection. I've been there multiple times and the Peking Duck never dissappoints. You should definitely arrive hungry. Their portions are good. The Peking duck is a two course meal that just keeps on giving and giving. Make sure you order the duck 24 hours in advance.
"If you want to eat here do this immediately:1) Call and make a reservation2) Reserve a duck early in the day3) BYOBThis place is a complete mad house at night and if you don't have a reservation, you are not going to sit down.  In fact, you will stand and be bumped into by waiters and waitresses.  But, if you do sit down and order some food - this place is magical and you forget the surroundings.  Best Peking duck in town.  However, I am going to take off 1 star for the spicy parmesan shrimp because it cost something like $16 and we received.... about 7 small (though tasty) pieces on a giant bed of lettuce.  Come on people."
My husband & I were introduced to this restaurant by our Chinese friends.  The food was authentic and good.  The place was packed but the service was quick.  We had the Peking Duck after reading all the reviews on Yelp.  It was good.  We will definitely go back there soon.
"My Japanese wife has spent the past six months scouring the Metroplex for her favorite dish - Ramen.  When she first came home from this restaurant she smiled to me and said ""I found it!.""On my trip here we had calamari, ramen, Asian spaghetti, and Japanese chahan (fried rice.)  The calamari was good and we enjoyed the sauce.  The ramen was good.  (So good that my wife suggests this restaurant almost every time we consider going out.)  The chahan really tasted Japanese.  I would be surprised if someone in this family hasn't spent a significant amount of time in Japan.     On a side note, this place was established by a father and passed down to a son.  I've seen lace of inter-generational talent ruin so many fine family businesses that I am impressed when it is done well.  I never ate here when the father was still in charge, but the son does things really well. Kudos."
"I visited Mr. Wok today for lunch on the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers.  That and the fact that it's almost close enough to my office to walk.I probably ordered the wrong thing... I got the Hunan Chicken with Fried Rice & Pork Eggroll.  The food was good, although from the cute little pepper next to the item I ordered... I expected some heat.  There was no heat at all...even my fellow wimpy mouths could have eaten it.I also noticed that the patrons of Asian decent were given a 2nd menu from which to select their meals... I was only offered the regular menu.  There were quite a few people eating from large bowls full of broth and noodles, so I believe I need to go back and try something else.At 1205pm this place was packed today.. and the only open table was a huge round table designed for an 8top with a lazy susan.  I was also a tad turned off by the fact that I had to walk to the ""expo counter"" in order to pay.  Seriously... people don't need to be standing at the counter watching the waitress fill plates with rice."
Excellent Chinese! Family owned. Orange peel beef is out of this world. My favorite spot for lunch.
"Their cha han is hands down the best fried rice in the metroplex. I first sought this place out because I had heard it had good ramen (pre-Ajisen era).  The ramen was fair, but there was nothing particularly notable about it.   And then I tried the cha han-- perfection.  Flavorful without being greasy.  There's actually an entire Japanese menu, but I've never managed to tear myself away to try anything else."
"its true that service is great, very friendly .. but food wasnt really that great. or atleast what we tried... vegetable lettuce wrap and peppercorn chicken."
"What an amazing Peking Duck.  I had read reviews all week and also on yelp and made my reservation for our duck.  It did NOT disappoint!!  Probably the best Peking Duck I have ever had...ever.  Our group of 4 arrived hungry at 11:30 and by 11:45 the place was full of diners.  Nearly everyone had the duck and it was just amazing...juicy meat, crispy skin, hot tortillas to wrap it all up.  And the most amazing was the soup afterwards made with the remaining duck bones.  Did not expect it to be anything special and it was awesome with flavor.  We tried the sampler appetizers and they were very delicious as well as the green beans that were smoky and very flavorful--a perfect counterpoint to the rich duck.  We will be regulars from now on!  YUM!"
"If you like American Chinese this place is better than the rest.  If you like real Asian food there are many better places in Greenville Ave.  Everyone seems to like the Peking Duck, which I didn't try, but one dish doesn't make a restaurant.  I really wanted to like this place but it failed my test, I was in the majority, i.e., there were more non-Asians than Asians eating. Very, very ordinary!"
"As far as local mom and pop places, it doesnt get any better...we met friends for dinner and had ordered several items:  fried tofu, edamame, water spinach with garlic- all terrific!  I am vegetarian, so the rest of the table shared peking duck, then  sesame chicken, pork with salted vegetables, mango shrimp and a sauteed peking duck dish with the ""carcass""- all looked phenominal.  everything was so fresh and you get huge quantities to go home with.   At 8 PM on a Thursday we got the last parking spot and the last table- this place is a gem"
"The low review is for the atmosphere, not the food.   The food was amazing but I would recommend take out only unless you are with a large group that can make a reservation.   Without one, expect a 30 minute to 1.5 hour wait during peak dinner times.   I was there with my boyfriend and after a  30 minute wait, we were finally seated at a small table for two in the middle of the dining area right in the path of the wait staff.   We spent most of the evening ducking whenever the wait staff came thru as the area was so crowded they literally had to bump into us and hold the trays over our heads to make it to other tables.   The servers seemed to cater to the large groups.  I think we spent about 15-20 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order."
"Having read the reviews of other yelpers and having just finished watching bangkok dangerous (a terrible move) we had a hankering for asian cuisine and headed to Mr. Wok on many positive reviews.We had a mix of japanese and standard chinese food that was all well prepared and served quickly. We got there early, around 6pm, and watched as the restaurant filled up with regulars by 7pm. We had dumplings, potstickers, orange beef and ramen noodles,  watching a movie that bad made us pretty hungry. We also got a pork egg roll and a cinnamon beef egg roll as i've never heard of or tried a cinnamon beef egg roll.The dumplings and potstickers were good but I'm not sure if they are made in house, I still prefer jeng chi in richardson if I need a dumpling fix.The orange beef was good flavorful but not overly sweet or spicy. The Ton Chung ramen soup was very good and very filling. I will say that the orange beef is served a single serving portion and not the heaping platter you will normally get at a chinese restaurant so if your planing on sharing make sure you order enough.The pork egg roll was your standard egg roll and very good. The cinnamon beef egg roll was good, but different. It a sweetness that the cinnamon provided that I can't saw I look forward to having again but I wouldn't refuse it if someone offered it for free.All in all, it was a nice meal and close to big M little urphy  and we would go back again."
"This place is really an under appreciated gem.  They have great flavors, courteous service.  I love the mushu chicken and the duck and authentic ramen noodles for lunch."
"I've had amazing Chinese food in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York and this place is up there with the best. The food is fresh and inventive and the service is flawless. I couldn't recommend it more."
"Our favorite Asian food by far. We've been coming here for years. Try the specialties and avoid the basic stuff. Crispy tangy beef, mango shrimp, and Thai curry are the best. It's great food."
"This one is real easy. The food here is very good.  First, the edamame is seared on Mr. Woks Wok and has a great taste.  Second the calamari was as good as anything I have tasted in Spain or Italy.  The pot stickers were some of the best in the city.  The Duck?  The Peking Duck was simply brilliant.  Carved at your table and the bones are then used to make stir fry and or soup.  We did both and they were great.  I highly recommend Mr. Wok."
"I've gone to Mr. Wok more than a handful of times & have always had a great experience. By far the highlight is the Peking duck since this restaurant's known for it in the Chinese community. Remember to request this at least 24-hours in advance so they can have plenty of time to prepare it. Then again, he usually has a few extra's just in case. The calamari appetizer's just the right texture to start off your meal. The hot & sour soup (family recipe from what Jack said) is tasty as well. Also, the mango shrimp is indeed flavorful. Checkout their variation of edamame with soy sauce (wok seared) along with the Beggars chicken (whole chicken stuffed with sticky rice & then the chicken's wrapped in dough). When you're in the mood for something soupy, I'd recommend one of their Japanese/Chinese noodle soups. Soft noodles & tender meats yet so healthy with all the vegetables along with the flavorful broth.Along with great food, there's also great service especially from the owner, Jack. He not only wants to make sure your food's flavorful & delicious, but also your overall experience is pleasant. It has to be good if little elementary school kids are writing to thank him! :-p Every time I've gone there, he always has a big smile on his face regardless if the place's busy or not. That's always a good thing to see right when you walk into a restaurant."
"Great peking duck, can't say that any other dish that i've had is worth mentioning.  would like to try the beggars chicken some time."
"We went with friends who are regulars here. I am so glad we did. It's hard to find good Chinese food in a city that is being taken over by poor buffets. Mr. Wok is in a class by itself. Our dinner was great from appetizers to dessert. We had edamame, dumplings, and crab rangoon. All were better than anything we've had lately. All the dinners were delicious. I know this because we all had to stick our forks in everybody else's meal. You can't help yourself, because the presentations are enticing. Not fancy, but a lot of eye appeal. Dessert was a yummy banana and chocolate chip roll. It was fried to perfection. Not a drop of oil on the plate. The kitchen is more than willing to adjust recipes to meet dietary needs. My husband and I did not leave a crumb on our plates .As an added bonus the prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is BYOB. Service is outstanding.  I highly recommend Mr. Wok."
This place is awsome. I believe they recently remodeled and are now calling it Mr Wok Asian Bistro.  The inside is much nice than the outside leads you to believe.  Great ambience.  The food is excellent. My favorite dish that I get every time since I was a teenager is the Seasame Chicken. They do it really well here.  I am an adventerous eater so when I eat Seasame Chicken at a place with regularity that is saying something.  Go Mr Wok...and the owner are cool for sure.
"I admit that I had my doubts coming into this place. Coming from California, I would say that my standards for Chinese food are also pretty high. Still, Mr. Wok surprised me.We ordered the edamame, yaki soba, and peking duck. The edamame, traditionally boiled, was stir fried. It brought out the aroma of the soy beans but also took away from the nutritional value. The yaki soba was terrible: soggy, sloppy, and mixed with the wrong sauce. The peking duck is one of the restaurant's specialties. So special that you must call in and reserve one--first time I had heard of this.The duck is brought to you fresh from the oven and carved table-side. First the skin, then the meat. The remaining parts can be either stir-fried or made into soup. We chose the former, and the experience is akin to eating ribs. Meanwhile, the meat and skin are mixed into a pancake (think tortilla) with oyster sauce and green onions. Overall, this was definitely the highlight of the meal. The duck was large, flavorful, and well-prepared. If I had to nit-pick, I would say that it was a tad dry.Service was very good on a day when the house was full. Oh, and this place is BYOB. And the owner's a cool guy."
"Mr. Wok better Wok himself over to Asia. The food was OK. I mean OK, nothing special but definitely cleared my plate. I ordered the sesame tofu and the flavors were right but not the texture. when cooking tofu in replacement of meat you normally batter it then fry it so there is some crispness to the pallet. At least in my standards. I love Asian cuisine of all types and am excited to try their pad Thai. A nice plus to this establishment is that you can sub out meat for tofu in any of their dishes. The tofu appetizer was cooked well, now only if they could incorporate that into some other dishes. I sound like a broken record, tofu, tofu, tofu, come on guys give me a few more options on your menu. I realize veggies aren't prevalent in TX but at least Cwok down the street had a pho-duck. On another note, It could of been the fact that i had take out but the portion was kind of small for 6 bucks. Overall I will probably eat there again but I won't be going out of my way for it."
Awesome Peking duck and mango shrimp! Not pretentious and just a great restaurant with good food.
Best Chinese in Dallas / try pot stickers and mango shrimp // this place is the opposite of a PF Chang's in the sense its real good not chain Chinese food.
definitely one of the best bowls of ramen in town!
We heart Mr Wok!  Owners Jack and Amanda are a lovely couple and so much fun to hang out with! We love love the shrimp with mango dish. So good. We're definitely going back again and again and again
"Went to Mr. Wok for the first time, we were seated promptly but were not served at all for over 1/2 an hour!  We were actually ignored while the staff fussed over another customer right next to us.  We saw entrees being served, condiments given, tea refilled all the while being ignored.  Finally someone came to us saying they were not a wait-staff, but had we been served, we said no, they apologized and we ordered appetizers.  We ordered salt and pepper calamari and hot and sour soup.  The soup was cold and the calamari was chewy, we should have known better and just left but we ordered anyway.  All the dishes tasted the same with one exception, the shrimp and mango which was outstanding.  Too bad the service was horrific, we will never go back again and we left no tip as this was the only recourse we had against such terrible service.  Shame on Mr. Wok for being so indifferent. I have never written a review before bit felt compelled to do so now because I would have given this establishment years of dutiful patronage if only they cared enough for every customer."
