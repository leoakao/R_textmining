I just want to say that this place is near perfection. Like  ... You don't get just good food you get a really good experience as well.The dishes are just so flavorful it really doesn't matter WHICH dish you select.
"For a while now, my friends have been raving that ToT is the best steak house they have been too, so I've long anticipated going. I can definitely see why they feel that way. The experience had its unique highlights, one low spot and a swift recovery from that. (Skip to the last paragraph for the tl;dr version.)First, parking.... dropped my two friends off at the front door and was told ""good luck"". Parking lot seems undersized, but I quickly found a spot on the other side of the restaurant that wasn't too bad.We were early, so we took a seat in the waiting area where there are TVs, free popcorn / chips / fountain drinks, and the bar. My friend and I ordered some Old Fashioneds which were super sweet and not the best, but also not the worst we've ever had.Our other two friends arrived, one of which was celebrating her birthday. Not much more  time went by before we were being seated.As you walk through, take time to look around and appreciate all the art and imagery on the walls. We got sat in a smaller section of the dining room where one wall is all wine storage. The atmosphere is definitely on point for a top-notch Texas steak restaurant.We placed our food orders and got two unique experiences. The first, and one I liked the most, was being walked to the meat counter to choose our cuts of meat. I chose my filet and my friends were sharing a Tomahawk. They stab a numbered tag in the meat so you know it's yours when it comes out. The second unique part is the Salad Bar. I was less excited for this, but it's cool you get to build your own salad and make a healthy green dish as unhealthy as your heart desires.I added a side of Mac & Cheese and Asparagus dressed in Hollandaise Sauce. My bacon wrapped filet came and looked yummy.... except it wasn't the medium I requested but rather, on the verge of well done. I let our Server know and he apologized profusely. Then a Manager came out to apologize. I think the table next to me even apologized. So many apologies. They fired me a new steak that came out quickly, and was cooked correctly. However..... they forgot the bacon wrapping. Oh well, I want to eat! My sides were quite yummy although the hollandaise on the asparagus wasn't as tasty as I would of hoped. Good thing I enjoyed my sides, because they brought me two more of the same, for free, for messing up the steak. They brought the Birthday Girl a free dessert. My meal also came with a free dessert as part of their apology, so their recovery was effective. I can be bought off with food. Shouldn't be a surprise.Overall an easy 4.5 Stars. Awesome atmosphere, top notch service. Great experience choosing your own cuts of meat, and cool concept with the salad bar (if you're not feeling lazy). Though they made a mistake over-cooking my filet, they quickly fixed it and gave me enough freebies to make sure I was full and satisfied. Everyone else at my table loved their food and the service. Would definitely go back."
"A Houston institution- you haven't lived here until you've been at least once. I've been several times but my husband never had so decided to let him see for himself on our wedding anniversary what the fuss is all about. Let's start with the obvious: I hate they don't take reservations. I think everyone does! However with ample seating, snacks and drinks it's bearable. I had the stuffed chicken and husband had a ribeye. I think next time I go I'll just get the salad bar, that place is heaven. My husband was very happy with his steak and no complaints from him. We got a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was sweet. It was huge! All in all a great dining experience to mark a special occasion."
"The best steakhouse in Houston.  Steaks, trimmings and service are top shelf.  I wouldn't bring a first date here -  your next date couldn't top it!Finest steaks cooked to prefection.  Everything about this restaurant is classy. Free parking and easy freeway access.  Wait staff the best in town, efficient and you never have to wonder where they are, nor are they in your face."
"First time here and they don't take reservations, but have a nice waiting area with chips and salsa, soda and popcorn. The food here is VERY GOOD, your meal comes with a salad which is also delicious. The atmosphere was chill and family oriented. Dress code can be very casual to business and this place is kid friendly. If you're looking for a great steak this is the place to go!"
"Oh how I love Taste of Texas let me count the ways....I love you for your devilish Melba toasts with insanely good cherry jam and cream cheese. It's not my fault I have 3 plates of them.I love you for your Brussels sprouts with bacon jam that give a girl flutters just thinking about them. I love you for your bone in ribeye that's never dry and with crisp seared edges, dripping with juice (oh god how can anyone avoid beef?) I love you for the salad bar that's always bountiful.I love you for those spiral cheese breads that are so yummy I almost get too full....almost!I love you for the good service and always leaving snacks out for us while we wait for a table.But most of all, I love you for selling that damn cherry jam, for which my life would be incomplete without."
One of the nicest decors in all of Houston. The rich wood grain chairs and pillars with granite bartops. The salad bar is very well put together. Refrigerated plates all fresh veggies and plenty of GREAT options. I would literally go back here just for the salad bar.  The steak was extremely tasty. Although a touch overdone but I assume that's just based on the COMPLIMENTARY bacon wrap on my 10oz filet. Grilled shrimp was also very pleasing. Well prepared and Charred grilled shrimp as well as grilled veggies with plenty of that smokey goodness. The sides were a bit underwhelming. The asparagus was overdone to the point the asparagus spears had little to no snap or crunch. The Mac and cheese was well presented however the gooey cheesy goodness you think of with Mac and cheese was just NOT there. The Texas au gratin potatoes were also less than impressive.   The butter and cheese were just super greasy. All In all the entrees and salad bar are worth the cost alone. The sides on the other hand do need to be recalibrated.
"I'd heard a lot about this place, but had never been. So this visit to Houston my family decided we wanted a good steak place....although I don't eat beef.....but I was sure they'd have other options here. What my mother constantly raved about was the salad bar here......sounded good to me.What a really cool place this is! Huge dining area...loved the high ceiling Texas ranch resort feel to the place. Service is definitely top notch from the time we entered through the doors and all through our meal.....everybody was so nice to us. Our server was so nice and friendly and did a great job making sure we were happy throughout.As I'm not a steak eater....plus it was getting rather late this evening, I decided to eat healthier....focusing on the salad bar, and so decided on the Salad bar with Grilled Chicken. Others ordered prime rib, fillets, salmon, etc. For appetizers we ordered to share the Crab Cakes and Stuffed Mushrooms. Oh, before I forget, we were served a melba toast like bread with a cream cheese and berry spread......and oh boy!.....this was so good! I never asked others how their meal was, but I did overhear my brother comment that his prime rib was not very tender.....I wonder if it had something to do to the lateness of the evening and that one of the servers came over to tell him that there was only an end cut of meat left? As for my grilled chicken....it came after I had already gone one round at the salad bar, and finished. I thought the grilled chicken breast was good......just right with a nice big salad. The salad bar was impressive....not so much its size, but the quality of salad offerings we could choose from.....I particularly appreciated that the plates are kept in a cooler so that our salads remained cool....everything at the salad bar was really fresh and yummy.....however, it was a bit late in the evening so I just went for one round. Oh, I did try one of the stuffed mushrooms.....yum.......and some crab cakes......eeerm, tasted a bit fish to me, but the crab meat were nice big chunks....my brother and mother liked them.I never expected us to order any desserts after all this food, but my mother insisted on a Chocolate Cake which wasn't on the dessert tray.....our server had informed my mother that they did still have some, but it was a very big slice...too big for just her, and nobody else wanted any,.so she settled for the Key Lime Pie......too sweet for me.Overall a very pleasant dining experience .......good food, excellent service, wonderful ambiance."
"Amazing!!! The staff was incredible, the food delicious, the ambiance was Texas. What a perfect way to finish our vacation. When a company puts pride in product and invests in their staff first there is nothing but excellence coming out."
"This place is fantastic.  The waiting area is very well organized, you received a ticket number which can be seen through out the screens outside and inside.  There's complimentary snacks such as chips, salsa, drinks.  Great waiting area, the salad buffet is amazing.  The streak is superb, really can't go wrong with this place.  Great decor and ambiance.  Definitely worth 5 stars!"
"I have been wanting to try this place FOREVER, but I've heard mixed reviews and that kept me from coming in. Flash forward to my cousin graduating college, we wanted to take her somewhere to celebrate and she wanted steak so here we came! So this place does not take reservation, we waited an hour for a table for 7, but it was definitely worth the wait. For appetizers we ordered the quail wrapped with jalapeños in bacon and the baked Brie. Holyyyyy baked brie! I could of eaten it by itself and been satisfied. I'm usually not a fan of quail because it can get super dry if not cooked correctly, this was not the case! The quail was super juicy and had amazing flavor! I thought it was really cool that they let you go back to the meat counter to pick your steaks. I chose the rib eye cooked medium (next time, I'm coming for that tomahawk!). It came with the salad bar and mashed potatoes as my side. The salad bar had such a big variety of different greens and extra toppings. I would of liked a bigger selection of cheese for the salad, but that wasn't a big deal. Once my steak came out and I took a bite, I could have cried. It was soooo good! Tender and juicy with the perfect amount of salt and pepper. I drowned it in the butter they top the steaks with and ugh, pure perfection. Dessert. I don't even know how we even had room for it. My son and I shared the vanilla ice cream in a toffee cone, we also had bites of the apple pie, and huge chocolate cake! I'm sad I never came to this place sooner, but I'm glad I finally got to try it. Worth the wait, the money, the everything, this could possible be my new favorite steakhouse!"
"Went for my Birthday..I knew I wanted to go for my birthday 2 months ago..been on a count down. Arrived early...2:45 because they open at 3:00 on Sunday and I wanted to be seated right away..(I'm old now and hate waiting) Was seated right away as soon as family members arrived. Always nice atmosphere there for me and very relaxing. Most importantly, the filet I ordered was incredible as it always is. If you have never been, don't miss the salad bar or the bread/honey butter is a must. As it was my birthday  dessert was complimentary and quite tasty. Family there made it even more special. I will always go there when I want a great steak. To top it off, for the first time in history, my recently graduated daughter, (GO COOGS !!) picked up the tab..miracles never cease....Service was great also.....like I say, Get in..Get out...Enjoy"
Had my 30th birthday dinner here. Food was delicious and service was awesome! Thank you for making my birthday dinner a wonderful experience!
"Center cut filet cooked to perfection! And please try fried shrimps, they re just amazing!"
"Had to come to work in Texas for a month, and absolutely had to have a steak. Really did not want to go a Saltgrass chain store, I wanted a something a little more authentic. I found Taste of Texas on yelp so I thought I would try it bout. I've been there twice now and both times it did not disappoint. The service is great and very helpful and friendly. I ordered a Tomahawk both times and I highly recommend them. I did not go to their butcher shop on my first visit, but made it a point to go on my second try. Adam C showed me and my party the finer points of choosing a steak and what makes a great steak. It was very informative and he actually was very helpful in selecting prospective steaks to eat. Their salad bar is amazing and worth the visit alone. All in all I highly recommend this place."
"Been wanting to try Taste of Texas for awhile. In fact, I had to convince my wife we should dine here as we made our way from Austin to Houston. She gets weirded out by places where the carpet actually smells like 15 years of cuisine. The dining area (even with carpet) is quite nice. Possibly a bit dated when compared to the way upscale steakhouses (modern vibe) have progressed over the years. What really impressed me initially upon being seated is the amount of staff they have on the floor. We were immediately greeted by what I would guess was the section manager followed by our server. The amuse bouche was a nice touch pairing whipped cream cheese and a spicy pepper mixture similar to what Fischer and Weiser makes in Fredericksburg, TX. Small garlic toast is also provided. I actually thought this was the bread offering having not seen the well stocked salad bar. We both selected 6 ounce filets as our protein choice. Me being escorted to the meat case to choose my own while the wife freshened up. After tagging my steak, onto salad bar heaven complete with 3 different bread choices. Amazing cheese rolls, jalapeno cornbread, and mini loaves were over the top delicious. We both made it back to the table with salads we personalized courtesy of the near endless combinations available. Nice touch on the cold plates; shaving the blocks of cheese takes some practice. Mrs. Rooster noting the sun dried tomatoes and caprese salad with mini mozzarella balls was here favorite. I also enjoyed the Caesar dressing; wished I would have made room for the creamy cactus dressing as well. Our steaks arrived cooked to our desired temperature. We both had selected the green beans with toasted almonds and bacon based on our servers recommendation. I think this was the only foul of the entire meal. It seemed they were blanched and the topping added afterward. Imagine them being sautéed in bacon grease. Bacon bits were really tough to eat too. Not knocking a star off because this basically is a personal preference. Will be back!"
"Solid steakhouse. I love the experience here. The main downside is that they don't take reservations; however, they have a back room with free cokes, chips and salsa, and popcorn while you wait. If you've never been there before, make sure to tell them it's your first time and they will set you up with a great experience."
My boyfriend and I came here for our year anniversary and loved it! From the wine to the amazing salad bar to picking out our own steak and then how amazing everything tasted! Our server was awesome and took care of us great! Definitely will be back
"DELIGHTED , I'm so satisfied with my dinner ! The tomahawk steak was seasoned well and packed with flavor the appetizer of my choice is gonna be the potato soup because Ive had a lot of bad potato soups nut this potato soup surpassed all expectation with striding colors. we went there with family to celebrate my son 13th birthday , he got  complementary dessert even know we were stuffed.The bathrooms had tvs in the mirrors !!!! this is how people get hemorrhoids LOL . BUUUUUTTT I did get to watch the astros v bluejays while washing my hands (awesome).what made the experince good was everything (that includes the astros beating the bluejays ). if you have small children that cry,whine, scream or make lots of noise youll get  kicked out there policy is children can be seen not heard ! and ... WARNING  this is a upscale classy place so proper attire is required !"
"It's amazing how busy Taste of Texas gets - I told my family we should get there well before 5:30 to beat the Saturday crowd; we got there at around 5:40, and we ended up waiting about 20 minutes. No reservations at ToT, so you either gotta wait it out or get lucky! Fortunately, they offer complimentary soft drinks outside, and for extreme wait times, they serve light bites.Once you're in, this place is packed. ToT has an upscale feel to it, but by no means is it exclusive. Obviously you come here for steak, and it's worth it, especially with a lovely trip to the salad bar. You put exactly what you want in your salad (if it doesn't taste good, that's your fault), and the bread is delicious, too.Steaks are, of course, excellent - if it isn't, send it back! Service is top-notch, and you can even ask for a cute commemorative photo if you so desire. Kiddos get a bandana (to take home!) and a cowboy hat (not to take home) for props...I wanted that bandana and cowboy hat, and they were more than willing to acquiesce!ToT is most definitely on the higher end of Houston dining, but I'd say it's worth the splurge periodically. You don't ever have to dress to the nines like other steakhouses (although you certainly can!), yet you still get a quality steakhouse experience for the most important thing: steak!"
"Perfect place to have steaks. I've tried many other places, this is the only time I was impressed by the steaks. Very tender. Love it."
"This steakhouse is my family's go-to when we are craving steak. The ambience, the service, the salad bar, the entrees, the sides and the desserts are all perfect. My only complaint is that the wait time is typically 1-2 hours during normal dinner times. They do offer drinks, chips and salsa, and popcorn for you to enjoy while you wait, so it's not that miserable of a time. The indoor waiting area also features a bar. The outdoor waiting area is roomy as well, but it still gets crowded.The salad bar is amazing. Full bar of toppings and cheeses that you can cut yourself. But five out of five stars is for the bread. Oh my lawddd the Parmesan rolls are to die for!The most ordered items for our family includes the Ribeye with garlic butter, Porterhouse with garlic butter, or the Cowboy one. Literally. Melts. In. Your. Mouth. The flavor is perfect and the garlic butter doesn't take away from the steak taste.Try not to fill up on the salad, cause your steak entree also comes with sides and a dip for your table. We've tried the baked potato, asparagus with hollandaise, macaroni and cheese, and normal fries. All are pretty standard, but that's not what you're here for, right?Our waitress checked on us frequently and refilled our waters often. Their staff are always smiling and polite, as expected from a classy restaurant. Don't be afraid if it's your first time cause they will guide you through everything! Superior experiences, superior food, superior service."
"No reservations, but the waiting process isn't too painful, as there is a space with tables and complimentary chips and dips, soft drinks, and popcorn, plus a cash bar.All our food was delicious, and I just think that the value per dollar you get here is excellent - huge salad bar (which included massive blocks of cheese - yum! - and bread), you can go back to the ""butcher shop"" to pick out which cut of meat (it's like a mini field trip!), and you get a side with your steak (seems like most places charge you extra).  Service was excellent - they made sure to ask if we were celebrating a special occasion, and a manager came by to check on us as well.Food details: We got filets, Brussels sprouts with bacon jam, macaroni.and cheese, and the Snickers cheesecake - all were delicious.  I've also had their chocolate cake, which is great (as long as you are a chocoholic fan), but if I had to choose, I would pick Snickers cheesecake every time!"
"I'm from metro-Detroit, MI.  Perhaps I was giddy from just landing at the airport less than an hour ago but I found this place fabulous...especially the bathroom, lol.  First the atmosphere, then the food and finally we'll get to that bathroom.  My best friend that grew up with me in Michigan has now lived in the Houston area for over 25 years.  She is a 4th grade school teacher; she takes her class on a trip to this restaurant every year.  The owner comes out and educates the class on how to run a business and most importantly how to be persistent, that success mostly doesn't come overnight. It was Christmas time when we arrived so the normal Texan decor was replaced with a lot of festive decorations.  The place is huge with a variety of dining stations.  There is a cute little store where you can purchase coffee, pecans and other Taste of Texas original items.   My friend said she loves getting the soup and salad for a meal so I went along and did that as well. The potato soup was a meal in itself. It was so creamy, filled with a lot of potato's and bacon.  It was the best potato soup I have ever had.  The salad bar was filled with fresh items. There were two huge cheese blocks where you could shave your own cheese to add to the salad or to just cut and eat with the bread or crackers. At the salad station there were several types of bread in the form of buns.  There was also a large selection of fresh cut fruit.  You will need a Texas size stomach to eat at this place. Before hitting the road to drive out to the gulf coast we paid a visit to the restroom.  While in the restroom I kept hearing what sounded like someone giving cooking instructions. Finally I noticed there was a tv playing in the mirror.  What a novelty...at least to this simpleton it was! So much of a point of interest to me that I took several pictures of me near the tv in the mirror...in the bathroom.  The other ladies in the restroom agreed that it was quite the cool addition to a restroom to have a woman in the mirror telling us how to cook, LOL!   We talked about the mirror, the holidays, our families, where we lived...it turned into an impromptu party as few left and more came in. Good times; thanks Taste of Texas."
"If you want a great steak, come here. It's a little on the expensive side, but you pay for these experiences. I ordered a large juicy and delicious medium rare steak with lump crab meat. The steak of course was delicious, but the lump crab meat was the highlight for me. It was so soft to the bite and moist. Every bite I took I just wish it would have it replenished.I also ordered my steak with bacon wrapped around it. This one.. I never know why I get it because I don't think it pairs well, but really bacon tastes good on its own so why not?Have a glass of red and you'll just have a good dining experience. They let you pick your own piece of meat in the back. Salad bar has a gazillion options to choose."
"I must say, this restaurant provides a great experience. The decor is interesting and I love that they set their expectations on dress code and child behaviors. This is a steakhouse and as a non-beef/pork eater, I can't comment on the steak. However, everyone at my table exclaimed about how magnificent their steak came out. We did have one issue of the steak not being the cook of their choice (wanted medium and it came out well), but it was immediately rectified and the manager came over and was very genuine in his apologies. I had the marinated grilled chicken, which was plated beautifully and was juicy and tender. I will say, I believe that they put so much focus on perfecting their main entrees (steaks/chicken/etc.) that they seem to neglect their side dishes. I had the garlic mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and macaroni and cheese. I love eating garlic mash and these definitely need improving. They were not creamy as I expected. They looked/tasted more like something you would get from a cafeteria versus an ""upscale"" restaurant. The mac and cheese was eatable. It came in a deep dish and had a very thin layer of mac and cheese. This was also not creamy like I imagined it would be. The cheese was grainy and tasted like it was previously shredded, which may not be a problem for some, but I prefer creamy mac and cheese.Lastly, the bread choices have potential. They baked so much of it that it sits up there on the cold side. Even in the warmer, the bread is not as warm as it should be. The cheese bread is the tastiest and the jalapeño cornbread is second best.P.S. the salad bar was amazing!! Everything was so clean and fresh. I appreciate a good salad bar."
"This place embodies all that is great about Texas in one giant restaurant- friendly people, generous portion sizes, and good steak. I don't think the prices are too bad for how much steak you get, but even though it was good steak, it was just that and nothing more. The most amazing part about this restaurant is probably the waiting area, which has free soda, tortilla chips, and popcorn."
"We came here on December 22 for my boyfriend's family Christmas tradition of eating at Taste of Texas with the decked out decorations all around the restaurant. This was my first time coming to this restaurant so I didn't know what to expect. Don't think any other restaurant could out-decor this place as it is the most festive restaurants I've ever seen. Being so close to Christmas and everyone's on holiday, we had a 2 hour wait for our table. Luckily, we snagged a table and munched on the complimentary chips/salsa and popcorn while we waited.When we were seated, the service is exceptional. Our waiter was very attentive and provided anything we needed. I had said something to my bf that I was deciding between two different red wines (while the waiter was like 10 feet away) and next thing you know, the waiter was bringing out two glass samples of the two wines I had mentioned. He had overheard me somehow in that busy/chattering restaurant.The salad bar is awesome. The bread is awesome with cinnamon butter. I really appreciate that this is included and you have access to it any time and repetitively! I ordered the 6 oz filet medium rare. It comes out on a cattle plate with a tag on it, which i thought was cute. While the flavor and texture was on point, my steak was at a medium/medium well state. It barely had pink in it. It was still super tender and juicy though and the seasoning was perfect. My bf ordered the 16 oz ribeye medium rare as well, and it looked like a medium. Next time, i'll probably have to order one level down in order to get the doneness I'd prefer. For sides, I got the brussel sprouts with bacon jam. I'm not a fan of bacon, which is shocking that I would order this, but the brussel sprouts didnt' taste like bacon, it was more of the sweet taste that that jam gave to the dish.Dessert... YUM. My bf and I shared the snickers pie. It is so delicious and rich. At one point, I jokingly was hitting my bf's fork away from the pie and later, the waiter gave us a to-go box with ANOTHER SLICE of snickers pie ""for my bf's birthday"". He mentioned he saw us ""fighting"" for pie and gave us another slice!!! But in all seriousness, there's no way i can eat more than a slice of that pie, it's so rich. I gained my work out this morning back from that pie itself.All in all, exceptional restaurant (minus the wait). Awesome food and service."
I have been coming to this amazing steak house for over 30 years.They once had a smaller place over on Memorial Drive.The owners are obviously still very active in the operation.The manager Chuck has been there over 35 years!!! Wow!The very best salad bar in Houston with home baked cornbread and assorted rolls to compliment the salad bar.The steaks are incredible and last time I enjoyed the tortilla soup and the salmon.We were celebrating a birthday and they even offered complimentary desert. OMG on the Snickers cake!They took a photo and the waiter put it in a nice card with a personal Thank You.The price was very reasonable considering we had Silver Oak wine with our meal.Can't wait to go again tonight to celebrate with great friends!Joe
"Great restaurant for special occasion celebrations. The tomahawk ribeye is outstanding, 38 ounce with 14"" bone = meat for a week. Make sure you ask to pick your own cut to Taylor to your liking. The Texas Manhattan is a nice complement."
"This is my favorite steakhouse in Texas. They pretty much have everything right: the service, the price, the salad bar and the meat! The only drawback is that they don't take reservations and it's so popular that you really have to go at an off hour or you'll spend a lot of time waiting. I guess it's not too bad as far as waits go because they provide you with free soda or iced tea and chips & salsa for you to nibble on while you wait."
"First time visitor was a guest to someone else.. From the ambience to the wine selection the customer service, the steak and lobster that I had.  this place was top-notch for any type of dinner! highly recommended; although on the pricey side but well worth it I didn't have to pay as my lady friend lost a bet thinking theTexans were going to win!"
"The atmosphere didn't have a typical steakhouse feel to it, it was really laid back but, the waiters and waitresses treated us like we where in a 5 star steakhouse.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the wine list is shown on an iPad. The food was good, but nothing to write home about. I had the t-bone steak while my husband had the New York strip.  However, he enjoyed the steamed broccoli more than the steak."
"This place get very busy on the weekend so try to come early around 5ish 6 latest.Took my hubby and parents here for the first time and they love it.Don't get appetizers cause it can get you full really fast. Salad bar come included with your meal. They have cheese block and assorted bread. The cinnamon butter is so yummy.Do ask to go to the butcher shop to see the meat.We ordered the Tomahawk medium rare. Perfecto, taste soft and juicy. Definitely worth order if you come here. Dessert apple dumplings with cinnamon ice cream is a great ending to a perfect meal"
"I always feel underdressed at this place when I come here to eat. A couple of my customers like to eat here at lunch and since I am usually working in the middle of the day when we do lunch I look like the construction guy I am when I go. The inside of this place is very nice with some interesting displays on the wall in case you have to wait for seating. The food is top notch, great salad bar and the rest of the menu is great as well. It is pricey (for me anyways) but not as expensive as some steakhouses I've been to. I like the location just off the 10 as well."
"First time going to this location after being recommended it since I'm a steak lover. We got there luckily before peak dinner hours arrived that we got seated right away. **Service is amazing here, they really make you feel special no matter who you are**I came in super casually dressed in shorts and everything but I was happy with the level of service that was delivered. Since it was my first time, they told me about their specials and how things worked there. When you order a steak, you actually get to come to the area to choose your own steak cut which I thought was cool. And also you have this amazing salad bar that you gain access to for ordering a steak. I ordered the Cowboy Steak since I wanted to try something different, and I got it topped with their Garlic Butter. Make sure you get it!!! 5/5 dish came out perfect, sizzling with flavor. Their loaded baked potato was amazing along with their Mac and cheese. To top things off, since it was my birthday they also brought out a complimentary dessert to my choosing and got a picture taken with a birthday card! **5/5 Snicker Cheesecake. This is probably their most popular dessert for is reason, it's awesome. For the amount of money that we paid and the level of service and amazing food, it's definitely worth it if you want to celebrate a special occasion here!"
"This place is unpretentiously amazing! The whole setup is absolutely Texas Steakhouse and although you're seated pretty close to the next table it still feels cozy.I admit that when I walked in I was incredibly skeptical as the place was packed and with a long queue. Got me thinking if it was just a touristy spot or something.We had to wait about an hour for a table but it was done in a really nice waiting room with seating and free flow of drinks (non alcoholic but you can pay for some), tortillas and popcorn. Can imagine someone eating and drinking so much here that they won't even need to order any main meals.Got out seat and was led to the free salad bar. I would pay just to have salad here! The salad is amazing and great selection of everything including with huge blocks of cheese that you need to shave on your own. The freshly baked breads would shame some bakeries.So far so good...I was having such a good time/meal that I was worried that the steak might ruin everything.Absolute unfounded!I ordered the NY Strip, sort of my go to cut for any steakhouses that I first visit. Medium Rare and spot on cooking with great charring on the outside. Great meat cooked right, It's so simple yet done wrong so often. I really wanted to try the Ribeye and tomahawk, perhaps next time I will.This place is legit. Great food and exceptional dining experience. I'll be back for more!"
Nice place for occasion or birthday. Best steak house.Excellent service.Good location in Katy What a great place and the asmosphere inside of it. I will definitely come back here on my birthday.
"Love this place .. deff on the expensive end but usually good things ain't cheap.Place has good vibe, great service & the Steaks are amazing."
"There are restaurants that you go to once and think afterwards ... "" It was Good "" However once in a blue moon you get Greatness at its Best and feel dumb from it only being your first time there. I can assure you Taste of Texas is Great. The Salad bar, the drinks and the food is on a scale I have only experienced once in the past 25 years. When we first entered (Saturday at 8:30) we were told the wait was 90 minutes in reality it was only 45. I would change anything as it was a wonderful. They also have some pretty amazing desserts but the portions are so big there was no room for that."
"Through the eyes of a life long Bay Area resident, this is the quintessential Texas steakhouse experience. From the moment the front doors open to reveal the deer, bear and other wild animal carcass, to the moment your Californian eyes lock in with rifles and handguns on display, it screams Texas.I was absolutely impressed with the old world decor and the intimate, romantic feel of the restaurant. The host is dressed in suit and tie and kindly walked us to our table, which is an excellent touch. On to the food, which in my eyes, was he absolute star of the show.Salad bar:Fresh, crisp, ice cold greens with endless toppings and countless dressing options. If you were starving, you could easily fill up on the salad bar and that would be a huge mistake. RIght next to the salad bars, there are two warming boxes of freshly baked breads. Again, you would be making a giant mistake of you fill up on bread. Grab a few to try, take a bite of each and let them go.Just let it go!!Cow:I think it's fairly obvious to all that I did not spend countless hours researching Steakhouses in Houston to spend all my time and energy talking about salad, decor and guns. I did the homework to enjoy the top cow in the town.Cowboy SteakThis 24 oz. ""bone-in"" ribeye steak was served medium rare, exactly as I asked for it. Slathered in house hotel butter and served on a giant metal plank. The very first bite melted as I attempted to chew. The second bite was better than the first and on and on it went. By far, hands down, the absolute best steak I have ever tasted in my life. At a nickel under 50 bucks, that's a steal of a price. I've paid $75-$100 for steak in Vegas and none of them match this side of cow."
"I had one of the most amazing steaks of my life here. I was recommended this place from a friend and this place definitely did not disappoint. I came here with my bf and we both had a great experience. First off, the vibe and the service was top notch. The ambiance is very classy, but still had that southern feel to it. My waiter, Joe W, was SO helpful. He was very good at explaining the menu, and when we told him were heading to Austin the next day, he gave us so many recommendations of things to do there and even wrote some of them down. All the steaks on the menu looked awesome but I opted to go with the 24 oz cowboy steak (cooked medium rare) with lemon pepper and herb butter garlic sauce. The meal also came with a salad bar buffet and one side (I chose garlic mashed potatoes). We were able to go into the backroom and choose the cut of steak that we wanted, and Joe was great with giving us advice on which one to choose.When Joe brought the food out, he made us cut into the steak first to make sure that it was cooked to our liking. And when I tasted it.... OMG THE HERB BUTTER GARLIC SAUCE WAS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. It complimented the steak so well and the steak was cooked perfectly and so juicy. My bf got a 16oz NY strip and that was delicious as well. The garlic mashed potatoes was also very good, especially since I'm a garlic lover. I totally underestimated how big a 24oz steak would be and I was only able to eat half of it. When we told Joe that we were staying in a hotel, he put our leftovers in a microwave safe container and gave us extra utensils. 5 stars for ambiance, food, and service!!"
Aged beef was truly amazing!The portions were perfect to big! Quality presentation The only thing is they need bigger tables!
"For out of state/country visitors, Taste of Texas is my go-to steakhouse to give them, truly, a taste of Texas. The experience can be defined by a homey warm atmosphere, excellent servers who go above and beyond, delicious foods and an impressive salad bar, and the message through it all: welcome.Upon walking in, there's warm wooden tones throughout and an expansive dining area with high ceilings. It has a Southern Texas feel to it. There's a nice waiting area with plenty of seats with popcorn and soft drinks.Once seated, the server provides menus. There are menus in other languages for international visitors! If you're from out of town, be sure to mention because they will come by and adorn them with cowboy hats and bandanas for a picture. They print and put the picture in a nice ""Taste of Texas"" greeting card for the visitors to take home. The bandana is also a gift.The salad bar is quite impressive, with two blocks of cheese at the end and delicious breads. The salad area is well maintained and clean. The server will take you to the butcher's corner and let you choose your steak. We also got to get a mini kitchen tour to see where the magic happens!I enjoy steak, but I don't like eating enormous amounts, so I shared and filled the rest of my appetite with the salad bar. After finishing off the delicious main entrees, the server gives you a sneak peak of all the desserts, which all look scrumptious. I personally like the ice cream in a sugar basket.The restrooms are worth visiting. There is a TV screen playing within the mirror, which I found quite modern.Overall, the experience is perfect. Easy parking, very service-oriented staff, great Texan atmosphere, neat picture & bandana gifts for the visitors to Texas, and delicious steak."
"There is only one location and it is in Houston - 10505 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77024. This is the place to go to when you want a superb steak experience but not have to get too dressed up. The decor is western theme but the food is classy. I always order the Ribeye by the once, you are able to go to the butcher shop which is near the kitchen to select your cut, it is then tagged and cooked to your satifaction.Steaks or seafood this place will not let you downI gave them 5 stars but the only downside that I could think of is they do not accept reservations and most of the time there is a wait time from 30min to 2 hours depending on the night. Maybe one  day they will change that process"
"Taste of Texas is 1 part delicious food and 1 part experience. Great selection of steaks (tomahawk is especially good) and sides. The salad bar is next level. It is so fresh and delicious. The warm rolls are soft and tasty. The dessert tray features so many great items it's hard to pass one up, even though your still in a food coma."
"This steakhouse is one of our go-to places when we celebrate a birthday in the family. Here you can find the greatest selection of steaks, meats and a pretty awesome salad bar with lots of toppings and choices to choose from.The ambiance is very romantic and intimate, which deserves it's high praise for a steakhouse restaurant. One of a kind in the Memorial area in Houston, Taste of Texas has been a tradition for me and my family.While the wait time may be long, it is still worth the wait as you enjoy the other amenities in the restaurant facility. The menu has a great selection of food from steaks, seafood, chicken and the salad bar! If you have never been there before, for your first visit, please get the Tomahawk Ribeye Steak. That will make your first experience memorable!"
"I really intended to get a picture but when the food comes and it's this good you just want to eat. Be sure to order something with a salad or add it on. The salad bar is fantastic but at the end they have 2 blocks of cheese almost 2 ft tall to carve from that. Next to that is hot fresh bread with your choice of Butters. The cinnamon butter is my favorite. But don't fill up here the best is yet to come. If your feeling Brave they have a 38oz Tomahawk Bone in Ribeye.However I was there for a lunch and decided to keep it light with the Grilled Tenderloin Medallions. Six ounces of grilled Certified Angus Beef tenderloin medallions served over bordelaise sauce and topped with fried onion strings. Served with fresh asparagus, a baked blue-cheese stuffed tomato. It was cooked medium rare and was tender enough to cut with a butter knife. Very juicy and very full of flavor.Another favorite at the table was the Marinated Steak Skewer.Charbroiled beef tenderloin flavored with a spiced pineapple marinade. Served with wild rice, grilled vegetables. There were so many grilled vegetables each person had to get a to go box.The service was as excellent as the food."
"We had an anniversary lunch today with Jay as our server. He is the MAN! I will ask for him again for sure! Jay was attentive, intuitive, welcoming and accommodating. He was friendly, offered us a free dessert and a pic to commemorate our day. Our food- 6 oz filet and potato along with salad bar. The filet were so tender, cooked perfectly. The salad dressings tasted fresh made, real bacon and the works. We arrived before noon and the waiters were waiting for us, so we were seated immediately. There are other waiter helpers waking around, everyone was very nice and helped each other out. Oh and we had the key lime pie for dessert and ordered a slice of heaven to go. The food and service experience was exceptional. Completely worth the money!"
"Just arrived in Houston and my first thoughts secondary to business was that I need to find a good steakhouse! Three words... Tomahawk Ribeye Steak! Tomahawk rib eye is for the serious carnivore: 38oz of bovine hanging off your plate complimented with a pool of garlic or blue cheese butter. I'm a garlic guy so I chose that! The meat was tasty and well seasoned! Service was superb and the atmosphere was great! It is considered a casual restaurant but most folks here do dress up for dinner. Come early cause they don't take reservations. Going by our server, the place has been an institution for over 4 decades. I can see why!"
"Great cocktails, I had a center cut with crab meat and it was fenomenal. The customer service was top notch. A bit pricey but you really get it back in quality and service. Will come back"
Our 2nd visit. Waiting time was max 15 min. Very crowded as always.We got a better place than previous time. Lucky me !We ordered a Texas mule (10.95 dollar) and a Carmel Apple cocktail (9.95 dollar) which were ... p e r f e c t  made.I went to the (free) salad bar where was enough choice to choose something healthy. It was fresh and tasty.My husband had the Cowboy steak (55.95 dollar) and I had the Grilled Shrimps (29.95 dollar). Our waiter was Carlos DE. He (and the service in general) was perfect.We will come back in the future.
"What can I say? As a Texan, we LOVE our steak and this one is top notch - one of the best, if not the best, in Houston. I love love love the decor and the service! Southern charm and hospitality at it's finest. We come here for special occasions, like anniversaries and birthdays. They do not take reservations so if you come on a night close to a holiday, expect a wait - but it is worth it!The salad bar is fresh and awesome. We love going to the butcher to look at our meat of choice and it comes out stellar. The taste is delicious and presentation is great. I actually price compared the $/oz. and to my surprise, as popular as this place is, they have the best price around town. Can't beat it and can't say enough about this Texas treasure."
"First time at Taste of Texas was pretty great. Excellent service, good food, and a delicious drink. I think the only thing that separated this from 5  was the ambiance was a little dated for my liking, and steak houses have BIG competition in Houston. It was good - but not out of this world. With that being said - I would go back."
"So being a New Yorker, I wanted to see where this place stacked up next to Peter Lugar's. I'll tell ya the food was absolutely delicious. They don't take reservations, only walk-ins-even though we were a party of 10, we were seated almost immediately on a Sunday night. The decor is beautiful. Western, wood/cabin feel with dimmed lights very Texas. Our server Vera was amazing and very accommodating. It was super fun to be able to walk into the butcher's shop and actually pick out the meat. Vera was very informative and patient-she took her time to explain the different types of meat and how best to choose them. The salad bar is great, there is a lot of variety. The bread is very good. The side dishes however, seemed to have an overpowering taste. My sauteed spinach was drenched in garlic and that kinda killed the flavor I chose for my filet mignon. So in conclusion, this is a great steakhouse/porterhouse but Peter Lugar's is still number one in my book."
"Taste of Texas is true to its name. Quality steaks, great service, awesome salad bar, and gigantic desserts make this a favorite of my family. Wait time: expect to wait on a typical weekend. There's a full service bar and complementary soda fountain, popcorn, and chips and salsa to munch on! They will give you a number and you wait until that number is displayed on the many reader boards. Salad bar: most entrees come with unlimited trips to the salad bar. This is one of the main reasons why my family keeps coming back, the salad bar is delicious. The topping selection is fresh and the dressings are different and flavorful. The asiago rolls and cinnamon butter are my favorites. Cornbread and white rolls are also available. Then to top it off, there are huge chunks of cheese and fresh fruit! Steaks: the real deal. All the cuts are fantastic but I usually get the filet mignon. Try it with garlic butter or bacon wrapped for extra flavor! Sides: again they're all great, but I really love the brussel sprouts with bacon jam! Savory and delicious! The green beans and asparagus are always perfectly seasoned for a lighter choice. Desserts: they are very generous with desserts and also ask if you are celebrating a special occasion. Even if it's not on the house, the prices are very reasonable for the size of the dessert. My personal favorites are the creme brulee, pecan pie, and key lime pie! There's a reason why this place is always packed and people keep coming back! The food is delicious and served with true Texas hospitality."
"What a fun restaurant to go to for a steak night. I have to admit, Taste of Texas isn't my top to go place for steak, but I will choose this place for its atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, their steak/food is good, but houston has many good steakhouses.I love taking people to this place for a Texan experience. They will make you wear a Texas cowboy hat and a bandana bib if you're not from Texas. Staff are super friendly and professional, as you would expected. There's no reservations so you will just have to show up and wait. The waiting room has free soda drinks as well as other snacks. Both times that I was here, I didn't have to wait more than 15 mins.For the food, I always get the filet mignon with garlic butter sauce on top. My husband got his without the sauce and I think it's definitely better with the sauce. The husband and family loved the unlimited salad bar. And it's always fun to pick out your steak. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about steaks so he recommended which steak to pick based on how we wanted our meat cook. Overall a great place for a nice meal and I really enjoyed taking my family here for my bday celebration. PS: free dessert for your birthday!"
"By far my favourite steakhouses of all times. They greet and treat you like royalty to the end of your meal. I had different kinds of steak both my times of being here with my boyfriend. 1) First steak was the Poterhouse Steak grilled medium rare in which I ate it all by myself :D (it's pretty huge). They grill it to perfection and the waiter or waitress actually give you the option to go and pick out which slab of raw meat you want as your steak. Since this was our first time there, we kindly let our server choose the meat because of his better judgement. Minutes later, it came out so juicy and succulent that I just couldn't stop swallowing it down piece by piece until it was all gone. Then as we were standing up to leave, we see this other waiter bring in this HUMONGOUS piece of grilled steak with it's bones still attached to it. I kindly asked the table next to us what they just ordered and they said it was the Tomahawk Ribeye. I just knew I had to try that steak the next time I came here.2) So a few months after, it came to our second time visiting for a special celebration. And to celebrate this celebration, me and my boyfriend spilt between the Tomahawk Ribeye because for one, it's freaking HUGE and two, the waiter recommended that we share it. Although I satisfied my craving for this steak, it was not as good as I thought it would be. It was too rough for my taste as I had to chew it a lot for me to swallow. It was a good experience nonetheless.My favourite? Hands down, the Poterhouse. (Got me drooling again)Will I come back? Heaven's YES. (For another special occasion)"
"""The best steakhouse in Houston"", doesn't come around that too often. So needless to say, I was super thrilled to finally get a chance to visit. The restaurant itself is huge, with beautiful, rustic design both inside and outside.After the host sat us down, she offered us the wine menu on an iPad which I thought was pretty cool. One little thing I noticed is that they ask if it's your first time there or if there's any special occasion that brings you to the restaurant. I assumed they ask so they can lend a hand to make it even more special. After our waiter - Coby (super nice and professional) took our order, he asked us to proceed to the complimentary salad bar. Everything was very fresh and delicious!Onto the main dishes, I ordered the Rib eye (first item on the steak menu) plus one jumbo crab cake with a side of mac n cheese. And we also got a Center Cut Fillet with a side of sweet potato fries. My steak was cooked beautifully, perfect temperature, wonderful seasoning. It enhanced yet did not overpowered the flavor of the meat. The mac n cheese was very rich and creamy, touch of crunchiness with a thin layer of bread crumbs. I wish the crab cake was as heavenly good as the steak, it was just a little too cheesy for me and the consistency was a little softer than I imagined. And the lemon plus the hollandaise sauce really overpowered the flavor of the crab meat, too much acidity did not correctly enhance the cake, instead making it a little salty.I had to skip desert because I was stuffed with the steak plus the mac n cheese, and the delicious salad that the restaurant offers. A wonderful experience It was, I look forward to visit Taste Of Texas again to try out more food from their menu."
"In town for a conference and a friend took us here for dinner.  Outstanding!  The atmosphere was unique and the service absolutely spectacular.  The salad bar had everything you could have ever wanted; and then the entree arrived.  Timed perfectly I might add.  Had the prime rib, wife had the filet mignon with crab and Bernaise sauce.  Cooked to perfection with au gratin potatoes.  A must repeat; a great experience with old and new friends."
"Our server keep rushing us, the restaurant is not even full yet! Because we are Asian and not so good at listening, she talked fast and frowned when she need to repeat it again when we don't get it. Steak is nice but not enjoying the experience. Will never go there again."
"We frequent this place and have always had a great experience. The wait can be long at times but they do it right by having the best waiting area of any restaurant. There is a full bar, nachos, popcorn, and tea/sodas to consume while waiting.The staff has always been really exceptional, always explaining the process well and are on top of drinks; food ordering at your pace. Overall I think the staff are people that really care about good service and making people feel welcomed. You don't always get that at fancier steak restaurants. I almost always get the filet with a loaded baked potato. This come with the salad bar, fruit bar, cheese block, and bread. The steak is almost always spot on (with the occasional send back for adjustment) and the salad bar is as good as it gets. I've had several other dishes (Pecan crusted chicken, burger, chicken sandwich, French dip) but the steak is really why you go here. I've split a larger (10 or 14oz) steak with my wife and she'll order the salad bar only. This is a very reasonable way of getting basically 2 steaks for slightly more cost. Highly recommended!"
Favorite steak restaurant hands down! We love their amazing salad bar and the steaks melt in your mouth!
"""A Taste of Texas and a side of Jesus Christ.""We didn't like the fact that ToT plays Christian music!  The server threw away half-eaten appetizer and didn't deduct it from the check (she never asked if I wanted it wrapped up). The service, food, and menu selections were good.NO MILITARY DISCOUNT."
Great food. Great service. We went to Houston for a weekend trip and decided to stop here for dinner. It was on Sunday and very busy. The place was very nice. The server was nice and friendly. We were asked to choose meat. They had a good salad bar. Dessert was good.
"Just finished up lunch here and figured I would finally write a review after numerous other trips (work in the area and this is always a top choice for celebration lunches, etc...). Taste of Texas is a fantastic place to bring visitors to Houston. It's basically all the Texas stereotypes amalgamated into restaurant form and - oddly enough - it actually works for them. It's a good atmosphere and the decorations on the walls definitely give off an old cowboy town vibe. However, I'll hear people dub it the  ""Best Steakhouse in Houston"" and that's where I have to disagree. Do they do steak well? Absolutely. All of their cuts are top quality, and you can't go wrong with the cowboy ribeye or any of the center cut filets. Their salad bar is fantastic and offers a good selection of toppings (get the cilantro vinagrette - best dressing, by far), as well as cheeses and breads (can't beat a warm roll with cinnamon butter). I think their sides do tend to struggle, but since most the emphasis is placed on the beef, this isn't necessarily a huge deal and their desserts are also pretty solid (try finishing a piece of Snickers pie on your own, I dare you). I also can't fault the service, as their servers are always very accommodating and handle things professionally and promptly. What gets me is that at some point I think you are paying a little too much for the atmosphere. Having eaten at some of the other prime steakhouses in Houston (B&B, Pappas, Vic and Anthony's), I think Taste of Texas wins in the gimmick department and I don't think that is necessarily worth paying for. If you have out of town guests - absolutely bring them to Taste of Texas. They'll get a kick out of the place and enjoy a mighty fine piece of beef while they're at it. So, overall, I think Taste of Texas is a solid restaurant. They cook a good steak and offer other good options, as well, but at the price point, I think you're better suited to going to one of the other fantastic steakhouses in Houston and getting a less cheesy steakhouse experience, especially if you're a Houston resident."
"oh.my.goodness!!!!!What is there not to like about this place?! My ONLY complaint is the very small area when you first come in through the doors to get to the desk to be seated. People love to just stand there and it gets extremely crowded. Food: wonderful, fresh, hotI have only had steaks here, haha!!! Small toasts brought out with the jelly spread is wonderful. Quail bites are amazing. Salad buffet is wonderful. They offer cheeses, bread, and different types of salads and dressings. Steaks are to die for. Lemon pepper seasoning and garlic butter spread are free!! Other places would charge you to add these items to the top of your steak. Sweet potato was wonderful. My drink was always full. Manager came by to each table. Cheesecake and coffee was wonderful. I have also had their ginormous chocolate cake. Wonderful but really should be shared by at least 4 people, lol!"
"My favorite steakhouse in Houston! Believe me it doesn't get any better than this place. The salad bar, the steak, and the service are spot on. I love going here and I highly recommend it."
"The steak is very juicy and I suggest two girls to share one, otherwise you will be so full~~Don't miss the dessert! The chocolate mousse is soooooo delicious?"
Does it get any better than this?  Perhaps the finest steakhouse I've ever been to.  Remarkable quality and value.You get to hand pick your own steak from their in-house butcher.  All steaks are well-aged.  The price of the steak includes sides and salad.  I highly recommend the cowboy steak.The steak is well aged and flavorful.  Perfectly cooked to order.  Perfectly seasoned.  Easily beats other higher-priced steakhouses.The salads (buffet style) are excellent as well.The service is top notch.  The vibe is casual and family friendly.
"When I found out we were coming to Houston my first step was to find a steakhouse to eat. I immediately saw Taste of Texas and was super excited to come and eat here. And our experience was amazing, not only was the food delicious, but the service was outstanding. Good food is not enough to make an experience worth coming back, it is a total experience and we got that here. The desserts were so good, the snickers pie was my favorite. Thank you for making our 1st day and meal in Houston a moment to remember and to come back to!"
"I had dinner here last night. Arriving right before 6pm was perfect as there was no wait for a table, though slightly surprising as it was for 11 people. Two children were in the group, and the waiter asked if we would like the steak cut up for them. We happily said yes and the waiter observed one child smaller than the other, and cut the steak slices accordingly. It was a very nice personal gesture. Drinks also remained full, though a small pitcher generally accompanies the drink so even if our waiter wasn't on top of everything, it wouldn't have been an issue. The food was delicious, and perfectly cooked! I had the salad bar, which also carries fresh fruit and rolls. Then I moved on to the Baked Potato Soup, which was very creamy, soft, and had cheese stringing from every spoonful. I could not get enough of this! Finally, I had the Gold Burger with a side of steak fries. This was very filling, tasted great, and the end to a very memorable experience. Every time I've ever been to this restaurant has been exceptional, with this visit being no exception. The manager visited our table at the end to make sure everything was delicious, to which we couldn't stop bragging about the food or the waiter. We will be back for more!"
"We had a case of the Mondays and decided to treat ourselves to a deluxe take-out order at Taste of TX.I ordered the NY strip and he got the Cowboy Steak, both cooked med-rare.  I was a little concerned about the steak being overcooked en route home, but I was not disappointed; both steaks were still just right.Bonus tip: they will still allow you to visit the salad bar for to-go orders so you won't miss out on the jalapeño corn bread."
"Famous houston steakhouse where family and friends take visitors to. Pretty steep prices, would suggest splitting a steak and enjoying the fresh salad bar. Steaks are quite delicious, especially the filet in the garlic butter (specialty). Tried the ribeye which was very good.Came here during a nonbusy time, which is critical. I hear the wait can take 3+ hours, and there is a waiting room with free popcorn, chups n salsa, and soft drinks. But still i wouldnt eanna wait that long."
"I'm very sad to write this and give this 2 stars, but unfortunately I feel Taste of Texas  service has changed over time. My husband and I visited a couple of weeks ago, and when we go, we don't usually buy the steaks, because we prefer the chicken dishes or soups. With that being said, I feel that they definitely treat you differently if you aren't spending $100+. I understand this is a high end restaurant, my family and I have been coming here for years, but I am disappointed in the fact that I can see the difference with how some waiters will treat you, depending on what tip they will get at the end of the meal. When I used to come with my family and I would get just the soup & salad, I found it admirable that the waiters or waitresses in the past would still treat you like a customer who was purchasing a $40+ steak, but they have lost that quality over the years."
This is a great place to go for a healthy lunch  with lots of options . The salad bar is full of delicious items to pick from and my best dressing is the garlic cilantro . In addition you get some of the best cheese bread that is included in your lunch . All this for only 11.99$ what an amazing deal .We ordered two appetizers ; shrimp and the spinach dip which was a great choice .Plenty of food for lunch .
"One word... AMAZING!!! This was our second time here and yet again they didn't disappoint! Our waitress was SUPER...sorry, I don't remember her name. Love the salad bar...and the warm breads are a bonus! Mother's Day was wonderful!"
"Can you say awesome! I am so full right now, my body says stop but my mouth just wants to keep chewing. I had the 24 oz cowboy steak medium rare. This was a huge piece of meat but it was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. I also got a crab cake added on, this was good but the cheese to crab ratio was off. Nevertheless, it was still delicious. My boo thang also had the tomahawk. Thats like 38 oz of meat that was absolutely delicious. I choose the baked potato with all the fixings as my side and although good a tad dry for my taste. Overall, I came for the meat and it did not disappointed. I would rank them up there with del friscos except cheaper. They will have to step up thier service, which wasn't bad its just not on del friscos level. The sides also need work, but i would most definitely be back!"
"One of the first restaurants my girlfriend and I visited when we moved to Houston. We got a recommendation from a friend and I had just finished paying off my student loans from undergrad so we went out to celebrate.We got the Texas Quail Bites to start off. My girlfriend wasn't overly thrilled with the idea of eating quail, but I thoroughly enjoyed them. They were juicy and wrapped in delicious crispy bacon. Whenever you need to make something irresistible, just add bacon, right?I got the Cowboy Steak and my girlfriend got the Center Cut Filet. The best part of ordering the steak is that they take you into the kitchen area and let you select the exact steak you want. They stick a little metal number in the steak and then when it comes out prepared you know it's yours. The flavor was amazing, I didn't even need the butter they provided with the steak.While you wait for the steak to cook, they have an extensive salad bar (that could honestly be a meal in and of itself). They have everything you could possibly want from a salad bar including the super grains and kale. They have whole blocks of cheese to slice yourself and fresh breads. Everything on the salad bar is unlimited!! Just so much amazing food, I guess everything really is bigger in Texas! Do yourself a favor and visit Taste of Texas."
"This has become one of my family's favorites for a nice meal out. I originally took my dad and the family here for his birthday and my mom liked it so much we came to back for Mother's Day weekend!The only thing that irks me is that they do not accept reservations. I hate waiting for food... but they make waiting extremely comfortable. They offer chips and salsa, popcorn, and free water/soft drinks while you wait! They sometimes walk around with small hor'dourves as well. Beware holidays can be grueling... We thought we would beat the crowd having dinner at 5 PM on the Saturday before Mother's day but it seemed like other families had the same idea as well. Our wait time was quoted 1-1:30 hours but it turned out to be only an hour. Make sure you pay attention to the number screens which is how you know when it's your turn to be seated. I don't think you could wrong with any steak here. Steaks have always been cooked to our liking. If you like a more tender steak then get the center cut filet which is probably my favorite cut here. No complaints with the salad bar as the ingredients are fresh and neatly presented. The rolls, cheese pinwheels, and jalapeno cornbread are delicious and you can stuff yourself with these from the salad bar. Portions are generous here. Our family can share 2-3 steaks and order 1 or 2 extra salad bars for a nice full meal that is less on the wallet!"
"Average food for incredibly high prices. The service was great (we got a free dessert for a birthday) and the salad bar was one of the best I've had - it's even better than Brazilian steakhouses I've been to.I've definitely had better throughout Houston. Yes, the portions are huge, but when you consider how much bone and fat they have, it makes the prices unreasonable. We ordered the porterhouse and shared it, but a lot of it was tough to chew or just plain fat. The meat's flavor itself wasn't tasty either, it was sometimes dry and bland."
*UPDATE* Mrs. Hendee called me and was very sweet and apologetic. It shows great character when a business can actually reach out to fix and address issues of their customers.
"damn good piece of meat!  Steak was cooked to perfection. the service was impeccable, loved everything about the place with the exception of the decor.Will visit many times over... on pay day."
"This restaurant is really popular in Houston! They don't accept reservation but you can wait in front of the restaurant from 3pm. The servers are polite and do their best to serve you. It's a good place to celebrate with our family. Good atmosphere and good food especially steak which is famous. After ordering the food , they would bring you to the meat room to choose your steak and mark it.First time visit restaurant, they will free to take a picture to you with cowboy hat."
I want to give a big thank you to Norman Faust. When we came yesterday he really made us feel welcome and at home thank you to the waiters that help serve us as well we will differently be back
"This is by far, one of the best steakhouses in Houston!   It's gotta be the largest. They have the largest salad bar I've ever seen,  you won't be left wanting.. although you may be full before your entree since the salad bar also includes cheeses you can slice, fruit, and various breads to choose from(the ones shaped like small loaves of bread are the best...those are my weakness) along with the most delicious cinnamon butter I've ever had.I order the marinated steak skewer which comes on a bed of rice with grilled veggies.   If you still have room for dessert... there are so many yummy ones to choose from but my fave is the Slice of Heaven.   ( creamy fluffy and light white mousse on one side and chocolate mousse on the other enclosed in chocolate trim with raspberry sauce, with a huge star shaped sugar cookie on top.If you have a bday to celebrate they always bring out a dessert with a big sparkler and take a Polaroid picture as a momento.  If you're in a hurry during lunch or dinnertime peaks be ready for a long wait.. no reservations taken.   One good thing is they give out sodas while you wait."
Great place to eat but minus one star for the lack of enough parking and long wait times.
"This place is on my Houston top 5; if you're in for steak, it's definitely one of the two spots to go to.Service is A+ from begining to end. Prices are fair amd food... Well... Either if you're a big fan or nor of steak, you will enjoy it greatly! But, if you like your steaks, make sure your server takes you to the back to make your pick! It's worth it.Every dish is made classic style so you wont have any unexpected surprises. Also, with your meal, you get to enjoy a great salad bar.Enjoy!"
"First time here. It was amazing. Can't say enough good things. The wait staff really caters to you and makes you feel special. The salad bar is really good. I especially liked the different breads. I had the center cut fillet and it was cooked perfectly,  hot, tender and flavorful. For my side I had the baked sweet potato which I really enjoyed and I also sampled the brussel sprouts with the bacon jam, they were amazing! I really, really enjoyed this restaurant. Defenatly a special occasion place for sure."
This is my first time here and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Had 16oz ribeye medium well. So juicy and well flavored...
"This is our special occasion place to go! It's right down the street and the only negative is they don't take reservations. They have a huge separate dining space almost just for waiting. They offer free soda drinks and popcorn while waiting. There are tables, TV's and a full bar in the waiting area. The salad bar is huge and the options are plentiful. They have huge rolls and different choices of butter. My favorite entree is the prime rib. I have tried several sides and my favorites are the asparagus and baked potatoes. They give free desserts on your birthday so save room for that. The creme brûlée is my favorite and the key lime pie is huge. You can't go wrong with entrees here or service."
"I would not recommend Taste of Texas. They have no flexibility to accommodate handicapped persons needing specific accommodations, including a reservation so that Metro Lift services can be used. I'm sorry, ""our policy is..."" does little to meet the needs of some customers. If you don't know how Metro Lift (Metro with lift services for wheelchairs) works, they drop off and pick up 30 mins before or after the designated time. We needed to be in and out in order to meet Metro's s schedule. I will never eat here again. Perry's, McCormick & Schmick's, Truluck's... Anywhere, but here! Not very ADA friendly.Ps. Perry's - Memorial City was graciously accommodating."
"I love going to Taste of Texas. Their salad bar is delicious! I love mixing salad with chopped eggs and caesar dressing. When you order a steak here, they give you the option of having your server pick out a steak for you or being able to pick out a steak for yourself. What I mean by this is, if you choose the option of picking out your own steak, your server will escort you to the back where their selection of raw steaks are held and you can examine the steaks and make your selection. For those who don't have a clue how to choose steaks, like myself, the server does a great job of explaining how steaks are chosen: explaining marbling, etc.I've gone to taste of Texas numerous times in the passed year and they've only over cooked a steak once. It was my boyfriend's prime rib. I understand prime rib is usually pre cooked and that it is up to the chef to slice off a good piece. The chef cut off an overcooked piece and needless to say, my boyfriend was disappointed. We were out with my family and he didn't want to make a big deal out of asking the waiter for another piece and dealt with it. Other than that, they usually do a good job of cooking their steaks."
"Quite simply one of the best in the world. When it comes to Taste of Texas, its pure elegance, and pure deliciousness. This is an experience for your tastebuds, and your tastebuds will thank you for it. The quality of their beef is top notch, and they offer a variety of cuts for you to choose from. The cook of the steak is phenomenal, along with the presentation, and the service. The bill for most people is the tough part to get past. However, my bill was nearly $100/person, and i walked out feeling like i got a good value for my money. Yes, it is expensive, but if you want the best, you've got to pay for it."
"Taste of Texas is by far one of the best steakhouses we've ever tried. This is our second time here since 2012. We order the Tomahawk Ribeye, 38oz of goodness with a 14"" bone sticking out. We're from Orange County and we have ordered this cut before in different restaurants and it is pricey ($120 & up) in California, but here it's $60 and worth it! They also have a pretty awesome salad and cheese bar. For all of you foodies out there headed to Houston, TX in the future and want to have an excellent steak, trust me...this place is so good you'll want to come back for more. Our servers name was Sam C., he was great! He brought us to the back butcher kitchen to pick out our Tomahawk steak."
"Lets start the review by saying this place absolutely amazing. Let's start with atmosphere. This place has a great atmosphere, and it's fit for any special occasion. It has a very upscale feel but not to a point where you can't have a causal dinner with family or friends.Service The service was absolutely amazing. Our server, Joe, was attentive and great at what he does. He had complete knowledge of the bar drinks and food menu. Immediately after we were seated by our hostess, he started us with a couple of waters while we looked at the cocktail menu. We ordered an appetizer while looking at the menu. Our meals came with a delicious salad bar, so while we got our salad the server was doing his thing and getting our appetizer and drinks ready. Upon arriving back to our table our drinks were already there. About 2 minutes later, our appetizer came out. We had had a good 15 minutes in between the appetizer and entree which was perfect timing. After receiving our meals, we were asked if it was a special occasion. We said no, but it was nice sentiment. While eating our meals he was always checking back, but not being pushy, which is always great. After eating he boxed our leftover food which was a nice touch. Overall 5 stars on service! (ask for Joe)FoodThe food was to die for! My husband had the New York strip which was great. We were even offered to pick our steak out. It was cooked to his exact specifications and was seasoned perfectly. It came with garlic herb mashed potatoes and a salad bar. The salad bar was actually great as well. You make it yourself, but everything is fresh and delicious. I ordered the herb marinated grilled chicken with sautéed vegetables and sautéed spinach. Everything was great and hot! The glaze that came with my chicken was just right for the meal. It was a cranberry honey glaze I believe. As far as the food was concerned I loved it and say 5 stars. In conclusion, I have no complaints and loved my experience. I will definitely be back in the near future. Also Joe was an amazing server, so if you get him be prepared for a great experience."
I had been craving big Texas juicy steak for like 2 weeks. My husband brought me here for our anniversary on Saturday and I ordered the cowboy steak. Jesus Christ that steak was the best steak I've had in my life. I had them put the herb and butter seasoning on it and whoooaaaw!!! To die for!! I love spicy with my food so I ordered roasted jalapeños . They smelled wonderful. Our server Gus was great. Only reason I remember his name is bc we have the same name. I will be coming back agian when I'm craving steak bc they satisfied my taste buds.
"I liked that I got to choose my steak, however, the steak was cooked with absolutely no flavor. I chose a nice hearty tomahawk steak. The searing was beautiful and I thought the garlic butter would help but it was just very greasy and bland. The steak definitely needed more salt and pepper. Not what I was expecting. I brought the tomahawk steak home and cooked it myself. The quality of the meat was good and the service was fantastic but the food was only mediocre for a $$$ steak restaurant."
"If I could give more stars I would !! Exceptional service, and food! Even though we had to wait an hour it was so worth it we ate popcorn, chips and salsa and free fountain drinks and and had bar area with tvs for anyone interested. I myself sat and conversed with family over popcorn. The waitstaff and house staff were so polite,professional, patient and kind. This restaurant is ran like a fine oiled machine. The food was superb my party of 11 that was with a mixture of littles and adults ordered an array of items from the menu. One thing that stood out was the tomhawk steak perfection !! My waiter Jacob was the excellent!!!! He made this birthday girl one happy camper!! We will be back very soon!!"
"Sadly, TOT just isn't what it used to be.Atmosphere is terrible for a place for a ""good steak"" - kids running rampant, no control.  Sorry this used to be a nice place to take a date and enjoy a great meal.  Now you're dealing with people that are wearing cutoff shorts -seriously!!!??? I've seen better dressed folk at a Carnival cruise line buffet; just sad.That being said, I would give higher marks for the food, but apparently the kitchen ran out of salt and pepper.  I received a perfectly cooked 14oz fillet but it had NO salt or pepper or any seasoning...again, just sad.For a ""steakhouse"" of this purported caliber, and serving quality aged angus beef, its almost a crime to jot season the meat!!I will NEVER be back and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place at all cost, unless you're taking the kids out for an overpriced version of Ryan's or Sizzler."
"This is the best restaurant I've ever been to. The service is always amazing and the food is incredible. I've probably been there 50 times over the last 20 years and each trip is a treat. Heck, I took my wife there for our first date and we've been married almost 14 years now!Favorites are the free cheese bread, the jalapeño stuffed shrimp, and of course, the steaks. My wife frequents Napa California and is always pleased with the wine selection. Many top California vineyards are represented. Best part for me is that even though it's an amazing restaurant, there is no dress code. If you go for a birthday or anniversary they will often times offer you a free dessert to share. Very nice."
"I have been to Taste of Texas severaltimes and have always had a phenomenal experience. The staff is so nice and attentive. We've always been asked if we are celebrating a special occasion and everyone always makes a fuss. I love the free dessert and photo, such a nice touch. The old school vibe is fun, the food is excellent and for the experience, I feel the price is fair."
I've been coming here since they opened. I never eat red meat bit this place is great for their salad bar and plenty other things. I usually come for the salad bar the potato soup is great too. I had the Texas Punch cocktail today and it was fabulous not to sweat just right.
"So glad I got to dine here for my friend's birthday. They have the best salad bar at a steakhouse ever! Their bread and butter selections are so good!For entreé, I ended up getting the beef tenderloin salad because I was in a mood for a nice, refreshing salad with some meat and shrimp on the side because I wasn't in the mood for a big, hearty slab of meat. Those calories add up, man. My salad turned out to be very delicious. Then my boyfriend ended up getting the 16oz New York Strip steak and maannnn, that thing had so much garlic butter smeared, it looked very tasty. I didn't end up finishing my food, as always, so I packed it to-go and ordered some desserts. I got the Slice of Heaven and my friend got the Cheesecake and it looked like the cheesecake wasn't that important because they didn't finish it but the Slice of Heaven was pretty tasty and they liked it. Since it was my friend's bday we sang happy birthday and they took a picture of us then gave us each a little greeting card saying thank you for dining with them. Wow that's southern hospitality right there. Definitely coming back to try a hearty steak this time!!"
"One of the best steakhouses in Houston. I gave it 4 stars because of the long wait, otherwise it would hv been a 5 star. It's a well known fact that you wait at least 30mins any day between 6-730pm at the Taste of Texas. They do offer free drinks, chips, salsa and popcorn at the waiting area. The salad bar is very clean with a variety of fresh selection of dressing and vegetables, and fresh warm bread available. Our waitstaff, Jason was very polite, explained to my boys the different steak cuts and invited them to pick the steaks from the kitchen. Our Tomohawk steak was a more rare that we wanted and was redone to our liking. To make up for this, we were given a complimentary dessert of our choice. Could not ask for a better service, not to mention good food."
"Had heard a lot about Taste of Texas.There really isn't much to say about this place.Amazing service, food that surpasses your expectations, and just a great atmosphere.This is now my place for steak (especially the fillet!).  Salad bar is plentiful, and the breads (with different butters) are to die for."
"Thank you to the amazing team at Taste of Texas! We had (as usual) a wonderful experience, our waiter misheard our order, but quickly fixed it. The manager Jay, stopped by and apologized and ensured we were still having a great experience. Thank you!"
"Havent been here in years! Went with my gma today for a belated bday celebration....man have they stepped up their game on service! The wait staff diligently work together as a TEAM ! Its amazing...my drink was never below half way, a dirty dish never sat on the table,  they are very attentive, and the food matches! Course theyve always had good food, but you dont always find such amazing staff...keep up the good work guys!"
"Dinner today with a friend at 6 pm. INstant seating. Service best I've had in a looong time. Courteous, efficient and attentive. Never an empty glass. Not to mention constantly replenished salad bar and excellent dinne. We Alison had dessert and Irish coffee. Yum."
"Perfection of a restaurant. Everything was excellent!! Great service, salad bar is fresh with plenty of choices, bread is addictive. We had beef medallions and grilled shrimp. Decoration is very nice and cozy. Perfect place for special ocassion and worth every $$$ you spend. Cory, our waiter was professional and personable and attentive to our needs. General manager stopped at table to welcome and chat with us. We will be back !!"
"A big steak lover, I was so looking forward to eating here for the first time. Everyone has told me great things about the place and its gotta be good when its this busy and you have to wait all the time right? So the waiting area is cool and all, with nachos and drinks. Pretty short wait on a weekday night, maybe 10 minutes. The salad bar was like the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I'd come here just for that even... and the appetizers were all on point. Then I got to choose my steak, the texas cowboy rib eye, added butter on top. I have to admit I was slightly disappointed in it. It seemed rather bland and dry, a tad bit overcooked so it was on the stiff tasteless side. It was seasoned too lightly for my taste, and the meat was too tough and chewy for my liking. The price is fair, but it doesn't stand up against some of my favorite Houston steak houses. The key lime pie is good though. Not sure I would come back here, though the service is amazing, the vibe is great, just the steak was whatever. Maybe it was just a bad day, who knows. But it certainly did not live up to the hype."
"This was my first time to Houston and it was only a one day trip for me. I found this restaurant on Yelp and I must say, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a long time. Great experience from the minute I stepped in."
I love this family-owned steak house!! Best salad bar in town. Service is awesome! Steaks are juicy.
"What drew us here was The Tomahawk, which is a 30-something ounce ribeye steak. We are in constant search of a good steak, and honestly, we always feel extremely let down. Usually because of the quality of food, but also because steak is not typically cheap. We have not been able to find a place with an awesome ambiance, great service, and most importantly, great food! Until today! We made the trek from Austin to Houston, just to test out The Tomahawk. We were lucky enough to get there right around the time they opened, literally minutes before the storm of people appeared. We were seated in a timely manner. The server, Michael, was very attentive and showed us around the menu. We got a cocktail called The Hendrix Cooler. It was divine. We also got the shrimp appetizer, which was the least impressive item on our table, but still delicious. Our huge steak came with one side, garlic mashed potatoes, and a salad from the massive salad bar, which offers a plethora of choices. We added on a second side Dallas, as well as an order of the sautéed mushrooms. After ordering, we were escorted to the back to CHOOSE our own steak.Overall, the food was amazing. The bill came out to about $115, before tip. For literally the first time ever, we did not leave a steak house feeling extremely disappointed. On top of all of that, the manager came by our table to thank us for making the trip, and offered us a complementary dessert. Of course we were busting at the seams, but we did choose the pecan pie to take to go. (Kind of wish we would have listen to Michael, and chosen the Snickers cheese cake, but hey.) Michael also put our food in a container, and wrapped up the huge bone for our dog. We literally do not give five stars. Ever. But the food here, as well as the service we're completely outstanding. We never go to Houston, but we now have a reason! Side note: This steak is totally shareable. We left with more than half of it."
"Brought a client here the other night and what a great meal. The wait is always a bit of an issue but if you plan on it there is no problem.  Great steaks, cold beer and delicious desserts.  We had the turtle cheesecake and it is a two night dessert.  It's so rich you can eat on it for two days."
"Good lord sweet Jesus the best steak I've ever had and I'm from Cali. If I could give them 10 stars I would, where do I begin? The customer service was excellence(he deserved that huge tip) the salad bar is all you can eat so fresh and so many choices I loved, they take you to the back to select what cut you prefer and u can see which marbling you like, surprisingly my bill was so cheap for 6 people I expected at least 1k but was only $330. I would def come back here and already recommend all family and friends when they are around Houston Texas. Hopefully I can find one as good out here!"
COWBOY RIBEYE OMG!Jalepeno-fried Shrimp to die for!The best Pecan Pie I've ever had!!!Great service too!
"Both of the times I came here were for a birthday dinner. Before this I really did not enjoy eating steak as much as I do now. My friends raved about this place and I pretty much have to agree with what they were saying. Service is excellent. If you go on your birthday, you'll get a free printed out photo of you and your party, as well as a free dessert! I got the center cut filet with garlic butter which comes with a side and a trip to the salad bar. The meat is so tender and flavorful..... Yumz. Craving it right now. My personal favorite side is the Mac and cheese. So yummy and oozing of cheeeeeesiness."
My employer treated us to lunch and it was delicious!!!  The food was phenomenal as was the service the parking was scarce but I guess that's what happens during the peak of lunchhour on a Friday.
"Now this is a Texas steakhouse ! I've heard nothing but positive regarding this place and  finally got the opportunity to go.The parking is their free lot so no issue there . As you enter you are hit with classy meets Texas (if that makes sense); I mean there's guns and even a bear  but crowd is dressed proper and the service is top notch.But where this place excels is where it matters most...the !steak. For appetizer I had the tortilla soup  which I feel is worth skipping; not a great start .    You get the opportunity to choose your own steak which is fun little tidbit and boy is the steak delicious  ! The 14oz filet is up there in my personal favorite (and if you see my reviews I've been to many all over the u.s.). Topped with melting butter that adds to an already exquisite steak cooked properly, I have no complaints . Also on the menu is the ridiculous 38oz tomahawk  t bone . My brother ordered it and finished it proving the taste must have been good. Side was the mac and cheese that won't disappoint . Not  the best I've tried but again it will satisfy. Important to note each side is personal size not a la carte.    Each steak entrée comes with complete salad bar and it's a top notch one with great variety including dinner rolls. For dessert we had the apple dumpling with cinnamon ice cream; good not great but worth trying. I would probably go with something else next time.                                                             Overall: great steak!!!! The best of the best steak!!! Great dessert menu and excellent  salad bar that comes with your steak entré.    It's probably 4.5.stars overall (side dish good not great , soup was eh, dessert was good not great) but the steak is 5 stars all the way Cheers!"
"""Blown Away!"" That is exactly how I feel after my wife just tried this place for the first time.Vibe: casual, spacious, comfortableFood: fresh, tasty, properly portionedService: attentive, genuine, kindI think TofT's salad bar is better than Whole Foods, Salata & Sweet Tomato. Food was perfectly cooked with light seasoning to compliment the natural food flavors.  Bravo to the owners, management team and staff for creating such an unforgettable experience."
"Meat Fest!  I hadn't been here in 20 years and would love to go back tomorrow.  Perhaps the best ribeye I've ever had.  Impeccable service and a really cool atmosphere.Took one of my teammates here and as an ex D1 Lineman, he can take down some serious protein.  Well, the 37oz tomahawk was a challenge but it ended up being toast.  I had a 22 oz Ribeye and the thing was absolutely perfect.We'll need some serious gym time to offset this night!  Great crew, awesome food and thankful for such a great night."
"Very low key establishment but do not overlook this place. Plenty of parking in the back. Go in and get a reservation card and wait roughly 45-60 min on a busy night. Right off the bat, great service! Our server Robbie made us feel comfortable and we had a great time for our bachelor party. The manager came by to say hi as well and was really nice.ONTO THE FOOD! BEST BEST BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD! I would eat Taste of Texas over any fancy steakhouse in California any day. Everyone had their steaks perfectly cooked, it's amazing how consistent they are. I loved that they take you back to the kitchen to pick out the exact steak you'll be eating. Robbie was great in explaining the difference between a lean and a fattier steak. Also their tomahawks are on point! This place has great value for what you pay for, their salad bar has great quality. Their fruits and pineapples are perfectly sweet and delicious as well. The goto place if you are in town and love steak."
"I seldom use yelp to add a review but I just had to today. I went to Taste of Texas for the first time with friends and I didn't really know what to expect. I typically go to the steakhouse's that offer reservations and have valet service (I know that makes me sound snooty but I only go to these places a few times a year, so calm down ppl). Anyway, Del Frisco's,  Pappas Bros Steak House and Ruth's Chris had nothing on this! Oh my goodness, it was sooooo fantastic. So on to the details.. We arrived on Thursday evening around 7:00. NO PARKING ANYWHERE. We drove around the huge parking lot a few times when we eventually drove to the bed bath and beyond next door and walked over. (It was actually closer to the front door than their parking) Next, we received a number and were told it'd be a 15 min wait. Not too long considering how busy they were. There are lots of areas to sit and they had these monitors that post the diners number when their table is ready. When we were seated, Anthony introduced himself as our waiter and gave us a moment to look over the menus. My friends and I all ordered the 38 oz Tomahawk Ribeye with a side dish for less that $60. It also comes with a complimentary light salad bar and bread/cheese. My friends and I know not to fill up on salad when we came for the good stuff. We didn't have to wait too long before our ridiculous piece of meat came out and it was BEAUTIFUL! Now, my friends and I looked pretty silly attempting to eat this beast and I also heard the neighboring tables comment on the steaks when they were setting them on our table. First bite OMG... so juicy and flavorful. They offer some butterherb and other things you can put on top of the steak but I'm just a salt and pepper kind of girl. No need for me to mask the flavor of a well cooked piece of meat. Anthony is such a great waiter, he kept checking on us several times throughout our dinner to make sure we had everything we needed. He was very conversational too, which is always appreciated. My friends and I kept joking about how they were going to pack our leftovers to go and Anthony told us he had a method to this madness. The 3 of us ending up walking out of the restaurant with 3 togo boxes with a bone wrapped in foil sticking out of the box. FYI, this whole meal including tax and gratuity cost us $270 which came out to $90 a person. The same meal at another steakhouse would have easily cost us $350 or more. Just saying...."
This was a great steak house experience my friend and I both came in for just a weekend and wanted a great Texas steak. I'm from Arizona Chandler that is and other guest from Atlanta it was a great experience picked out our steaks staff and manager was greatest service ever I say 200% and yes it was worth the cost. I had the cowboy and he had the porterhouse. Cost doesn't matter if it bomb.! This what we do on a regular Enjoy and check it out when in H-town!
"Great atmosphere and service, food was so-so.  I'm a big eater and appreciate good restaurant and a good piece of meat. When my steak that I ordered medium rare came out cooked incorrectly I was a little skeptical about what is happening in the kitchen."
"5 stars and this is why...This is officially my ultimate favorite place to eat in Houston! Just pulling up to the restaurant has a major grand entrance. Ample parking always available. Depending on when you go there may be a wait. Usually on the weekends for dinner time you will have to wait approximately 20 minutes to 30 minutes before getting a table. Having said that you won't feel the way as you do at most other places as they have a very comfortable waiting lounge. The waiting lounge consists of complementary beverages popcorn chips and TVs as well as a full bar.Upon being seated the waitstaff is extremely attentive and quick! They have great knowledge of the menu, And are always pleasant. they have a large selection of steaks, but we always order the fillet. You have the option of going into the  kitchen area and picking out which steak you would like. No joke, the steak always comes out cooked to perfection! I highly recommend the Lemon pepper rub and the garlic butter. Upon ordering a steak entrée, it buys you a trip to the salad bar. And let me tell you about the salad bar! It is possibly the best in town! It also has a bread selection that consists of cornbread dinner rolls and another cheesy bread.The dessert menu is off the chain! I don't care what you order when you go there but you have to order the snickers cheesecake! Ahhhh mazzzzz inggggg!!!! Every time we've been here our experience always gets better and better! Shout out to Paul our server! If you have business meetings or guests from out of town this is the perfect place to bring them! Make sure to mention that they are from out of town for a special souvenir. They will truly get a taste of Texas!"
"This used to be my first choice to eat steak out and celebrate special occasions. We live in Bryan College Station so we drive 100 miles when we choose to dine there. They have a top notch salad bar that is quite expensive when ordered by itself. Now on to the steaks. It is nice to go into their ""Butcher Shop"" and select your steak however be prepared for the high priced options from which you select. They offer you the option to have your steak served on a sizzling metal plate. Sounds like a good idea and makes for nice presentation however you need to beware that your steak will continue to cook while on this sizzling metal plate while you are trying to dine. In other words, it will end up being well done no matter how you desire it to be prepared.They do not explain this and thus after paying $50- $60 for your choice steak it will be very disappointing to cut into a steak that you ordered med-rare to find that it is well done and thus dried out and tasteless. It is frustrating even more when they agree to bring you out another steak after you have consumed over half of the first steak that was over cooked.  Because your spouse had ordered a different item, you sit like a toad while you wait the additional 15-20 minutes for your second steak to be brought to your table. Instead of them offering to just not charge you for the over cooked steak or charge you only 50 % they bring you the second steak which you end up taking home and reheating it the next day in the microwave and having it be tough and dried out because it was not eaten freshly cooked. Do not waste your time contacting the owner as she will only call you and make excuses by telling you that they have over 70 cameras throughout the facility and their review of the videos reveal that everything was to their standards and they made things right by bringing you the 2nd steak at no charge even though it was 20 minutes after your initial complaint and your partner had already finished their meal while you waited for the 2nd steak to be cooked. By that time, you are no longer interested in eating your 2nd steak much less taking it home and re-warming it in a microwave and it being like a piece of rubber. When she tells you repeatedly that they have videos all over the restaurant and it appeared from their video  review that you and your spouse had a pleasant evening from the facial expressions they saw on the video, it makes you a bit uncomfortable thinking if they monitor you that closely, then you may not want to enter the bathroom as you may be on video. The owner felt they make things right because they got their money and do not care whether you had a pleasant dining experience especially if it was a special occasion. I took her comments and response as an insult. They could have offered a gift card to replace the steak and remove that charge from that evenings ticket rather than provide you another steak which will ultimately be overcooked when reheated at home the next day. Thus, I will not be returning for any occasion especially any special occasion. I would encourage others to be wary of their policy on making things right with a Customer. The owner pushed up to me that they serve 1000 customers per day as if numbers mean everything. It does not say much about Customer satisfaction as eventually all people will eventually get frustrated if they experience what we experienced on our 43rd wedding anniversary. The owner is more interested in making excuses and using her extensive video system to ensure she has a basis for her excuses. I encourage you to celebrate your special occasion at the many other restaurants in Houston that know what true Customer Service means. It should mean Customer Satisfaction and not owner satisfaction that they sent the Customer away full but not satisfied."
Well let's see here I would say we are well overdue on visiting this restaurant we normally come here about once a year or more but for some reason I have not been last couple of years don't know why exactly just haven't been as for the restaurant they've got a terrific's salad bar I actually used to know the guys son who designed and built it.As for the steak I like that you can actually go to the meat locker and pick out the one you want.Very good bread which is always a plus with my wife she loves the place is well we both decided recently that we will be going back soon almost went last week with a group but my wife said no way since we were picking up the tab on that event you are looking at about $50 per person could be more if you add alcohol to the mix.
best steak on the planet and salad bar phenomenal!!!! its soooo great i visited twice in one week!!!!
"Food was great, by far the best steaks and service I've received at a steakhouse. The only SERIOUS issue is upon arriving a waitress took our drink and relayed it to the waiter assigned to our table. The waiter verified with us and my girlfriend told the waiter which bottle of wine we wanted. This was a 60-70 dollar bottle of wine. The waiter then brought the wrong bottle out ( yes my mistake I should've verified for yet a 3rd time but nooope that's the plan on the 3rd time just when your getting impatient and you tell them yeah yeah yeah that's it....that's when they're gonna bring you the wrong bottle). He then proceeds to pour the bottle while we exchanging some small talk about how broke we are as college students and how we're just here to enjoy splurging before going back to school (oh they assist in the splurging) I enjoy my meal, the center cut filets  are to die for. Meanwhile thinking to myself damn this is some good wine. Ordered some bacon wrapped grilled quail also amazing. Salad bar was phenomenal, it almost seems like your full before the stakes even get there. ......and still this bottle of wine was going down smooth. We finish our meal and wait for the check only to be hit with the HOLY ***** $389 tab?!?? Oh the bottle was $256 ""sorry for the mix up"". What can you do tho it's a fancy place, you get he good ole swap, and you've already drank the bottle. Great place, won't be back again sadly. Be sure to check your bottle over and over again."
"This place is amazing.. There are 3 places I would take my family or anyone from out of town to have the true Texas steak-house experience, this is my number one choice..The food is phenomenal, the salad bar is excellent and fresh, the service and wait staff on point... Second best Ribeye in Houston, Best salad bar, best bread, best desserts.the bad -  they won't take reservations and you have to wait forever to get a table on a weekend evening."
"We were told the wait time is around 60-90 mins, but we were able to sit about 40 mins, and they even have the waiting area with free drinks with popcorns and chips.  Service is A+ and we ordered T-bone, Porterhouse, and Slow grill Prime Ribs, all taste very very good with additional sauce need it."
"Visiting Houston on a Texas roadtrip and knew we had to find the best steakhouse while we were here. After lots of researching on Yelp, chose Taste of Texas and have zero regrets - amazing dinner!!Our server was Henry, I can't imagine having a better experience and he was a main part of it. Super friendly and helpful, not only with the menu but with Texas information as well.  If you have him as a server you are in for a treat! For starters- the salad bar. Seems silly to review a salad bar, but this one truly was different. Fresh variety of ingredients, including bars of cheese at the end to garnish the salad. Rolls with apple and cinnamon butter that melt in your mouth. I had grilled chicken - yes at a steakhouse, but it was delicious. My boyfriend had the NY strip steak with crab meat - he was in love. He could have even chosen his steak if he wanted to. Side dish recommendation - Brussels with bacon jam. Oh. My. Goodness.  Yes it's a tad on the pricy side, but you definitely get what you pay for and you know that going in.  An amazing experience."
"This place NEVER disappoints. Every time I have friends or family visit from Canada I take them here. The food is outstanding, and the staff are professional and well trained. The parking lot is pretty big and the decorations for Christmas are a must see! Only con: there can be a long wait time, so don't wait to go until you are starving. My definite go to spot!"
"Great from the moment you walk in, valued as a customer  pampering you all the way, everybody greets!!110% and beyond going the extra mile.Our host and waitress Anna walked us to see different cuts, took pics, gave us a free bandana for good Texan feel..the steaks and all are to die for!!"
"Five stars alone for the food! So good! I could eat here every week and I'd never get bored. The salad bar is great because it also has fresh fruit and different types of freshly baked bread. I filled up on salad and bread, so I couldn't finish my entree. My steak was cooked to perfection though. I thought it was cool that you get to hand pick your steak from the back.The service is definitely five stars. Everyone was so friendly. Our waitress helped me pick out my steak because I told her I had no idea what to look for in a steak. One of the best steaks I've ever had! The only downside is the bill at the end. Even though it was a bit expensive, I'd definitely come back for more."
"My husband and I had dinner today at this restaurant and it was absolutely a TOTAL FAIL!!!! We waited over an hour to be seated then we get to our table and order our steaks and they did not make the steaks as we ordered them!!!!  They burned my steak, the manager came over and said they can remake my steak but it was going to take awhile. I said no thank you, we waited all this time and you want us to wait another hour to make my steak because you all did not cook it the way we  asked in the first place, no!!! Then my husband asked for them to box up his food because he did not want to eat if I was not going to eat, so it ruined our whole evening. I will never visit this restaurant again."
"The food and service was Great. We were Celebrating one of my Sons Birthday. Michael our waiter was Awesome and the wine, food and ambiance was Wonderful! It was Fun evening."
"Service: Impeccable. Really some of the best service ever, let alone at a steakhouse.Food: Tomahawk is a massive, juicy, and best piece of steak to share. They bring you to the kitchen and let you pick your steak. You need to try it al least once in your life and it's one of the best prices I've seen. If you're sharing, just order an extra salad bar. Dessert: Since it was my birthday, they give you a choice of dessert. I picked the snicker cake. It's a lot and definitely for a chocolate lover."
"My first visit to Taste of Texas and it's a very impressive restaurant.  It's very clear that management understands customer service.  We went for an early dinner, arriving within minutes of opening.  They were already packed!     If there's a wait for a table, which frankly, isn't unusual, they provide free soft drinks, iced tea and popcorn.  Fortunately, we were taken to our table immediately.  Water and bread were brought out immediately, along with a server to take our drink order.We explained we were there for our anniversary, and were told that we could have a complimentary split of champagne (their house) or a free dessert.  Then, the different cuts of steak were explained and we were taken to the ""butcher"" shop where we could actually choose the steak we would be served.  The steaks are ""tagged"" so you know you are served the steak you selected.All steaks come with the salad bar which is the basic salad  bar, enhanced with choices of blocks of cheese to shave and a baked roll section.  The bacon bits were the real deal and freshly fried and crunched.  My wife and I chose a large T-bone to share and ordered an extra salad bar and side.  We had plenty of food to share.The steak was a bit disappointing.  Well prepared, but under-seasoned in my opinion; and more thin than we expected.  I have no doubt it was the weight as described, but I'd have preferred a smaller slab and a thicker cut.  Still, it was juicy and tender.  If you can, save room for dessert....they are decadent.  Worth the calories for the extra 30 minutes on the treadmdill.Our server was what puts Taste of Texas in another level.  Attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, unhurried, smiling - no pretense you might normally expect from a relatively high end steak-house.  Remember, steaks start around $50 and go up from there.I did feel the floor managers looked like armed Secret Service agents.  They stood - non indiscreetly - in each dining area, wearing black suits, shirts & ties whlle whispering into their wrist radios.  I'm sure they were surveying tables to alert servers to low water, or a customer in need of something; but it was a bit unnerving.  They need to find a way to smile and blend in a bit better.  Still .... Taste of Texas is a locally owned treasure.  No chain restaurant.  Family owned...and a focus on service and quality.  There's a reason why the parking lot was full when the doors opened."
"Excellent food, excellent service. I have gone for lunch meetings and only ordered the salad bar and was very satisfied. More often we order steaks and never have they been over cooked. My husband likes his well done, and they have graciously cooked it more upon his request. There dessert menu is out of this world delicious. I like my coffee hot and they always have a cup ready. Highly recommend this restaurant for all occasions."
"Great decor and service, salad bar was great quality and quail appetizers were good.  Waiting area is very nic with snacks.  The tomahawk ribeye itself, however, missed the mark big time.  Significantly over seared with the associated bitterness and dried out crust while the inside bordered on being raw and cold.  It hadn't been salted/seasoned with anything or rested properly and was oddly bland.  I'm not suggesting they actually did this, but it very much reminded me of what happens when someone tries to grill a partially frozen steak.  The 38oz description is misleading as they are counting the huge bone hanging off of it as part of the weight -- it's big but no where near 38oz of meat, maybe 24-28oz.  It's normal to include bone weight but the bones they leave on these are gigantic, even by tomahawk ribeye standards.  We may try again but disappointing this time around."
"My wife and I have been coming to Taste of Texas for 30+ years and absolutely love the restaurant. There is only one of them--it is not a chain and the Hendee Family are wonderful!!! Nina and Edd have hired first class General Managers who hire a stellar wait staff. It is the best restaurant anywhere we've ever been. The staff are family and they treat you as you were part of their family. You can receive periodic newsletters by email and the perks are fantastic!!! From the Salad Bar, to the Butcher Shop where you can pick your own steak. Now living in San Antonio, we'll be back on our anniversary and my wife's birthday, but you will never be disappointed in Taste of Texas!!!!! UPDATE: Just had dinner in San Antonio with Stephen and Olga Edelstein on 05/13/2014 at Kirby's ( a San Antonio Steakhouse) because they were here Mother's Day. Stephen, now retired from Taste was on of their Senior General Managers!!!! Thank you Stephen and Olga for the dinner and fellowship!!!!Philippians 1:3"
"I visited tonight and was completely blown away by my experience! The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the ambience is very tasteful. We arrived at 6:30 and there was already an hour wait for two people, but the waiting area is very comfortable and large, and you even get free drinks and snacks to munch on while you wait. We ordered a fillet and a New York strip, both with the lemon seasoning and garlic butter, and they were AMAZING! The salad bar, which is included with the steaks, was very fresh and high quality and offered WAY more options than most places. The homemade bread was also delicious. The mac n cheese and broccoli were perfect as well. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food provided! The service was great! Everyone was very friendly and professional, and the attention to detail was outstanding. We will definitely be back!"
Oh my... If anyone go away hungry there is something wrong with them!   One of the best steaks I've ever had.  I like you pick your own out & salad bar is pretty damn good too with all the great bread!  Amazing!
"They don't season their steaks enough here. They rely on their ""signature"" sauces to top the steak for the flavor of your liking. Most of the steaks are basic grilling..not super juicy yet not dry. They always cook the steak to my request, but I always feel something is lacking.The salad bar is on point. Those asiago cheese rolls are dangerous.Wine is way overpriced for the brands they serve.Service is always superb. If you pay close attention,  management is running around non stop to ensure customer satisfaction.All desserts look divine, but the snickers cake is some of the best dessert in town. It reminds me a lot of Cheesecake Factory.Overall, this is a good family steakhouse. Not fine dining, but a step above the other chain restaurants around town."
"7 years of living in Houston and I FINALLY get a chance to experience Taste of Texas a few days ago.  My long wait was worth it though:  steaks are quite phenomenal especially with the lemon garlic seasoning on it to give you that extra punch.  I ordered the 6 oz center cut which turned out smaller than I thought.  I always forget how small 6 oz can be.   I would recommend sizing up to the 8 oz which is cheaper by the ounce if you do your math!  Our group also got the bacon wrapped quail appetizers which were so crispy and savory, I am starting to salivate just thinking about it.  The grilled shrimp dish also looked delightful as well if you are not a steak person.  I would definitely eat here everyday if I could but I don't think my wallet would approve.  I also highly recommend going at 3 pm any day (opening hour) so you avoid the long wait that everyone else complains about."
"I was blown away by the quality of food and service. They have a butcher shop in the back where you can pick your cut of meat which makes this a fun and unique dining experience. Steak was cooked to perfection and the salad bar was awesome. They also give you a side with your steak. The wait can be long, but they have a good size waiting room with tables, TV, bar, and provide complimentary snacks/softdrinks. I've been to several steakhouses all over the world and have never experienced this level of service. I would give more stars if I could. Highly recommend."
"Our waitress Christian was amazing.  She was  friendly and nice,  very upbeat she also was a wealth of information on the restaurant and different items on the menu.  We ordered the monster rib cowboy steak and split it.  There are no words it is beyond incredible. I want to go back and just do the soup and salad bar only next time.  The salad bar had a bunch of yummy choices.They also have a very nice wine selection.  The only negative is place looks out dated and very tired.  But that will no stop me from going back its  really good."
"Great great great place! The wait was super long (2 hours) but well worth it.  I have not experienced many waiters/waitresses as detailed as these were. Every second here was what any restaurant should be able to give you when dining.  While we waited we had complementary popcorn, and drinks. Our waiter had to serve over 15 people and he did it effortlessly! He was very polite, skilled and knowledgeable about everything on the menu from the appetizers to the desserts. The drinks were pretty good and once our food was ordered, it didn't take very long for everyone to get there meals once we ordered.  The tour of the salad bar and the pick you own cut steak won me over!  Any place that takes the time to care for their customers like that is admirable and I love it! All of the food came out hot and smelled like Heaven.  The prices are a bit on the high side but I can't complain about that.  Like the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for"". It was a truly enjoyable evening and I will be returning at least once a month."
"We love this place! We come here 2-3 times a year as a family and there's never a time that we don't enjoy the food and our experience as a whole. Sure, the wait time is usually long as they don't take reservations but their waiting area is the bomb (great ambience, free chips & salsa, pop corn and iced tea). You can also order cocktails while waiting. The salad bar is very good and the service is excellent! Totally worth the money! It's become a family tradition for us to come here every year and we will continue to do so."
Exceptional steak. I've had steak here before but this was the best steak I have ever had. Exceptional service and spectacular food. I would also recommend the salid bar which has a wide verity of salid a breads and dressings.
"Omg!! This place is not only so good but a great place for dinner. No matter what you order here you won't go wrong. If the wait is long, it's worth it! If your like me that likes the little things, you will appreciate picking your own steak for dinner.  kind of pricey but we'll worth it."
"I love so many things about this restaurant!1. The waiting section is awesome! It's a big room with a bar and lots of tables/seats for you to hangout while waiting. There are also free popcorn and water/sodas!2. The staffs are friendly and accommodating. The manager/supervisor came and check up on us...a very nice gesture. 3. Food & Drink- Porterhouse steak (5/5) - I got it with the garlic butter rub and it was amazing! The steak was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked medium! - Prime Rib (5/5) - I stole some pieces from my boyfriend plate and man it was soft and rich! - Quail bacon wraps (4/5) - Crab cake (5/5) - It was rich in flavor and just perfect.- Salad bar (4/5) - It's veggies and fruits are fresh! There are also a variety of toppings and I LOVE the cilantro vinaigrette (I have yet to see this anywhere else!) - Blackberry Mark (5/5) - This cocktail was perfect! It was refreshing and not that sweet, but man it's a creeper (either that or I'm a lightweight).By far, my favorite steak house!"
"Came here on a last minute decision for dinner with friends and family. I was glad they accepted my gym attire. Our group was huge but luckily they sat us down in less than an hour. This review is mainly for me and I am not speaking for the whole group. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice and fitting to the name : Texas. The restrooms were clean and a bit luxurious. Clean restrooms in an expensive place is a must. They have a separate bar area and even a wine room. We sat in nice long table and there was enough room for everyone. Our party was about 14 people. Ok onto the food. I had the cowboy 24 oz ribeye which was highly recommended. They let you pick your steak and you can also get yourself a salad plate with assortments of breads. My bf picked it for me and we shared the salad. I really enjoyed the complimentary tiny toasts and the cinnamon butter that you can get for your roll from the salad bar. The food came out in a reasonable time for big group. It was suggested to eat the steak medium rare so I ordered mine medium rare. However, it didn't come out that way. It was more cooked like medium and my bf confirmed this. Everything else was fine. The best part, the waitress and manager was very accommodating. This is why I give 5 stars because they both personally came to me and apologized and offered me a new steak to go and a dessert to make up for the mistake. The kind waitress. April was nice enough to recommend the chocolate cake and boxed all my food to go. I was very pleasant surprise about the customer service. That alone makes me want to come back and try their other items on the menu. P.S. The chocolate cake was pretty rich, moist and delicious!"
"Long Story Short, THE BEST STEAK EXPERIENCE ever.Not only the steak, the whole experience was amazing. Nice waiting area, very organized, and nice staff. Chips/Salsa, pop-corn and iced tea were available in waiting area, but keep in mind that you're here for steak not chips and salsa.Our waitress was very nice and as soon as she understood that it's our first time in their restaurant and we're not from texas, she brought us cowboy hats to take a picture. We got a very nice free printed copy with our bill btw.You have the amazing option to go to butchery and select your cut of meat. they'll put a small metal plate number on the meat to ensure you're getting the exact piece of meat that you've selected.Salad bar was full of fresh greens, but, again, you're here for steak so don't get excited with all these fresh vegetables and greens and don't fill up your stomach.Steak was perfectly cooked, exactly how we ordered them. tasty, juicy and tender. I don't remember anything other than enjoying every single bite until I was full.It was a joyful night and It worth every penny that we paid."
"If you truly want a taste of Texas, you need to come here. While receive a  premium selection of steaks and entrees, you also get the experience of a museum. History is calling your name from every corner of the restaurant... including the bathroom. If I could afford it, I would honestly come here everyday. Expect to pay a premium for this fine dining experience. However, it's worth every penny. I only feel bad for the cows."
"Ambiance:  Worth 4.5 stars. The atmosphere is great. You are immediately greeted by nice hostesses upon entry. The decor is beautiful. I just stood there, looked around & took a minute to take it all in. I am a sucker for a beautifully decorated place. Process:  5 stars. They take you on a quick tour of the salad bar & explain your options. Next, you are escorted to the kitchen area to choose your steak. Last, you are escorted back to your table. Service:  When I went on a weekday, service was awesome. Our waiter was very attentive & even let me design my own meal. Food:  3 stars. Yes, I am the girl that had seafood at a steak restaurant. And, boy did I regret that. The grilled shrimp was nothing to write home about.  I've had much better flavor at other places. My date had the Ribeye topped with garlic butter & it was delicious (not 5-star delicious but still good).  Ruth Chris' steaks are waaaaaaaaay yummier!  The salad bar was ok. Everything was fresh & the area was clean. The best thing about it was the BREAD!  Oh M Gee!  That butter cinnamon bread is amazing. I think I ate 3 or 4 of those. Yum!All in all, it was a good dining experience and I do plan to return. However, like others have stated, I do find this place a bit overrated."
"The salad bar was the highlight of the night.  We had drinks that could not have been made more perfect. The drinks were absolutely amazing! The steak however, left more to be desired. For such a highly rated restaurant, I would have expected nothing less than a delicious meal. Bland is The Taste of Texas."
"I love coming here ....been here a couple of times this year and the steaks are always  good.   The decor is very classy...and if you have to wait, there is a waiting room with free chips , salsa and drinks......the salad bar is always  awesome....the staff is good ...the prices are a little steep at 45 bucks per person but its worth it . ."
"My favorite place to eat a steak in Houston without having to get all dressed up!!  TofT has the best bang for your buck steaks as well.  They are Angus steaks as the menu claims and they have a nice variety of cuts as well.  Service is always excellent and if you're a first timer, you may get your picture taken with a cowboy hat and red bandana.  You do have to give the hat back though!I always order either the pre-sized ribeye or the order by the ounce ribeye, currently $2.35/oz.  To get the best value, choose a steak larger than 24oz and eat it all yourself if you come hungry like me, or share with your date.  It's cheaper to buy 1 big steak and cut it, than to buy 2 individual steaks. ....assuming you're both wanting the same cut.I'm not thrilled with any of the sides, except for the loaded potato.  They are all just overcooked from what I've experienced.The salad bar is always good, pretty fresh, decent variety of ingredients and well stocked.  I'll sometimes just get 2 servings from the salad bar and only eat a little of the steak.  I think they have the 2nd best salad bar in Houston, behind fogo."
"Oh. My. God. I fell in love with this place the minute I walked inside. My husband decided to take me here for a nice date night, and we were not disappointed. Brandon was our server, and he was just so sweet, accommodating, and explained everything for us first-timers. The drinks are extremely strong, which was a nice surprise, and I loved their cocktails. I got the steak medallions that came with asparagus and a bleu cheese stuffed tomato. Let. Me. Tell. You. That tomato was so heavenly, wow. My mouth had a party. My husband got a T-bone steak with garlic mashed potatoes. I, of course, had to try his mashed potatoes, and...best garlic mashed potatoes, ever. You can actually taste the garlic, hallelujah. Amazing food. Their salad bar...I just wanted to spend the night there with all the amazing selections. Honestly, I'd come back just to get to taste everything in the salad bar. The hot bread area, with so many different kinds of bread! I was in bread heaven. Finally, dessert was decadent. My husband got the snickers pie, I swear I think he teared up at how delicious it was. I got the slice of heaven: chocolatey goodness. Manager came to our table to check on us and if we enjoyed everything, and I just beamed up at him, lol. This is our official date night restaurant! Thank you Brandon, and ToT for such a wonderful night. We'll definitely be back to visit again!"
"Taste: I had the 24oz. Cowboy Ribeye with Herb Garlic Butter and Au Gratin Potatoes for my side. It tasted pretty good, I'd give this steak a 4 on a steak scale of 1-5. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because somehow certain pieces of the steak tasted bland but overall it was still a great steak. Make sure when you eat your steak to dip each bite of steak in the Garlic herb butter. Au Gratin potatoes are amazing and in my opinion the best side that they have to offer. Price: $50 for the 24oz. Ribeye that comes with a side is a very fair price in my opinion. You definitely get your money's worth. Not to mention they have an amazing salad bar. Service: Because they are so busy it may take your waiter some time to get to you but even with how crowded this place is the service is still pretty great. Again this place gets very very crowded and they do not take reservations last time I checked. When I got to the restaurant all of the parking was taken but fortunately we found a parking spot 5 minutes later. Wait times can be anywhere from 45-75 minutes, the lady in front of me had a wait time of 105 minutes. So make sure to get here early."
"Taste of Texas is absolutely amazing. From your first step through those doors to your last juicy bite, you are treated like VIPs. There is really nothing I can complain about.The restaurant is very Texan with very rustic and ranch-like atmosphere and plaques and trinkets of Texas history all throughout. Clean, of course, even the bathrooms deserve to be visited. The seating is great for any party size. The restaurant has many different areas that each boast a different ambiance. You can go into the more open part of the restaurant with high ceilings, or more intimate rooms for those celebrating a special event.The service here is always top notch. You are welcomed by pretty much everyone, and are immediately taken care of once you sit down. First timers get a quick but thorough run-down of the menu and just how everything works. The wait staff is always accommodating and attentive without being overbearing; they are there not just to serve you, but to ensure you enjoy your experience to the fullest.Taste of Texas boasts an impressive salad bar with a plethora of different greens, pastas, cheeses, dressings, and toppings. You'd think the restaurant had their own Sweet Tomatoes in it. The bread and butter are all so good too. Just make sure you don't stuff yourself too much before your steak comes.Oh yeah, the steak. To die for. Whatever cut of meat you decide to choose will be aged, seasoned, and cooked perfectly to your liking. And for those who are really particular with their meats, Taste of Texas allows you to go back there and hand pick exactly which piece you want on your plate. The meat melts in your mouth. You also have the option of ordering sides, toppings, and butters to compliment your steak.For the steak maniacs out there, you can get their Tomahawk steak with is a bone-in excessively massive cut of meat. I'm probably wrong, but it's something like 40 oz. Just HUGE. Of course they have their non-beef proteins like chicken and fish, but honestly I haven't ever gotten anything other than steak.So for anyone who loves steak, is looking to celebrate a special occasion, or just wants to enjoy a very nice meal, Taste of Texas is the place to go. Yes, on the pricier side, but definitely worth it..especially compared to other steak houses. They offer excellent service with amazing food, and is my top choice for premium steaks."
"Parking lot is small and gets packed. 20 minutes to get a spot but ITS SO WORTH IT. Complementary chips and salsa, soda, popcorn and tea while you wait for a table. Service is attentive. Hey brought me a pitcher of diet soda so I could refill my own Diet Coke. Salad bar is yummy. Food is cooked to your absolute liking and they have you check it as soon as it comes out. My kids enjoyed it, the adults enjoyed it. The manager visited our table and was very gracious and kind. We will be back. Yum."
"My favorite steak house in Houston (although B&B Butchers is a close second). Old Texan ambience with an amazing salad bar, bread is to die for and you can pick your steak before they cook it. Meat is awesome and tender and not over spiced. Great steakhouse!"
"It was my first time eating here and I must say that it was quite the experience. It was my first time choosing my own steak, and our waiter Jacob was very professional and accommodating as he helped me through this process. The salad bar was to die for, the steak was grilled to perfection, and the free dessert that I chose for it being my birthday was great. Everyone was dressed to impress, and the ambiance had a dim lit cozy feel to it. It is definitely a place I would love to visit again."
The wait is ridiculously long but on the plus side you can eat snacks while you wait. The center cut steak is the best don't even think about ordering anything else it's so juicy! First time they'll let you wear cowboy hats and give you bandanas to take back. Great place for a birthday dinner.
"This is one of best Steakhouses in Houston.  Although the prices are rather high, you get a lot for your money. Unlike other high end steak places, a huge salad bar and ""sides"" come with the meal.  They are not al la carts.  Great food and great service.Hint:  Go early or expect a long wait."
"IMO the best casual steak house in Texas.I love that I can pick the cut of meat, as they have a wonderful selection!  I love how friendly, casual and inviting this place is!  It's truly a wonderful experience every time I get to go!  It's warm and great for the holidays :)I LOVE the salad bar and the bread and cheese selection.  The last time I went, I had the bone in ribeye and it was sooooo tasty.  I usually get the prime rib, which is always buttery smooth and super thick.  I don't think I've ever tasted anything here that wasn't mouth watering."
"The perfect night! Our waiter was so formal and nice and the food was incredible! We ate way too much salad bar, it was just way too good with all the topping, cheese and fresh bread. Martinis were great too. The best part by far was the tomahawk steak, 38 oz of juicy hot steak-unbelievable! And we got to choose it which added a nice touch to the experience. Also, you absolutely HAVE to try the bacon jam Brussel sprouts... they are something straight from heaven. I love this place and I wish I could go every day! The only bad thing about it was the 2 hour wait which was expected, but totally worth it!"
"Very unique steak restaurant portraying the old Texas with beautiful decor and a grand hall...I was quite impressed upon walking into this place, free popcorn, nachos and soda while you wait....their steaks no matter which one is $40 plus but it's worth it for the experience, a lot of variety in steaks and you get to go to their butcher shop to choose it....I personally don't know how to pick out a steak so just had my server do the honors....the steaks are HUGE, don't expect to finish one yourself, after eating at this place I didn't want to have steak for a long time, overall the steaks were juicy but just a tad too salty for my liking, their signature sauce was the garlic butter....excellent customer service here, our waiter took the honors of getting is cowboy hats and taking a picture for us....salad bar was included with each order Wouldn't come back often but mostly for special occasions, a definite try for new comers though"
"I know most people come here for the steaks. However, I am not a steak person. I took a chance and ordered the pecan crusted chicken. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again. They have a salad bar that is very nice. Great atmosphere and service. The only thing I would change if I could  would be the parking situation, very cramped during peak hours but thankfully they have valet."
"I like this place alot. I have been here, and paid for some large means with family on Birthdays, ect..  However , we ate here on Sunday night and we felt sick.  It is Tuesday and still a bit queezy.  Bring that both of us shared 2 steaks, it seems that one must have been the culprit.  I will not give up on the restaurant as I enjoy it when I am in the area, but not a good experience for the $ 160 dollars laid down for a meal that night."
"I had heard from several people that I needed to try this place. We are big fans of steak and were looking to be impressed. We were not here. This place is huge and the atmosphere is a little weird. They have a very large room where they have patrons wait for tables, where you can get sodas and popcorn on the house. That is a neat feature, but at the same time, it feels a bit commercialized and weird. Once we sat down, we were kind of let down by the food. Everything was just ok, and for what you pay there, it should ""wow"" you. It doesn't. It's just ok."
A coworker and I came here after a long day of travel and loved everything about it! From the friendly staff to the meat it was an incredible experience. The best part of this place is you get to go pick your own piece of meat out. If you are looking for some Texas charm and a good steak this is the place to go!
"Really had a great experience at Taste of Texas. The staff was extremely courteous and our waitress Valentina was very attentive. It's a pricy steakhouse, worth every penny. You get to go to the butcher and pick out your specific cut of steak, the dinners include an awesome salad bar and 1 side. The steak was perfectly cooked- get the garlic butter topping, its spectacular! My only critique is that I ordered the white cheddar mac n cheese, and didn't care for it. It wasn't very flavorful, and the texture was a little off. Our waitress quickly exchanged it for garlic mashed potatoes that were great. Homemade breads on the salad bar were super tasty. Oh, and you MUST have the snickers pie. Ganache bottom, chopped snicker bars, creamy cheesecake, and graham cracker crust with whipped cream. Its the.bomb."
"We knew when we came to Houston that we want to visit an ""upscale"" local restaurant and this one won. We went on a Monday during lunch Aron d 2. Our server was Robert and he was phenomenal. He walked us through the menu and gave us his recommendations on steaks based on what we told him we liked. After deducting the cowboy, he walked us to the butcher to select our steak and gave us a custom number. With my steak came a salad bar and it was great! Even was able to get different bread options (asiago cheese, regular roll & jalapeño cornbread). The entree came out after about 20 minutes.  I like my steak medium and it was cooked perfectly. To me, it wasn't very flavorful (compared to Houston's) but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Robert was very personable and we stayed behind for an extra 15 minutes getting to know him and vice versa. I would go back for the service but not the food necessary. Still a great place!"
"This is our favorite spot for every Soecial occasion in our family, especially birthdays. On January 5th; however. I asked for cowboy steak, instead  I got a 10oz prime rib. Tough and hard.Honestly, it was my birthday and this waitress, was rude frim the very beginning. This is not my first rideo at Taste of Texas. My family and I have been here at this place since 1992. When I asked the waitress if I can have a sauce, she told me I could go myself and get it from the bar. Not the salad bar, but the waiting area.  Very cut dry, just rude. Then my husband I proceeded to choose our meat, We did. When, my meal was out to my surprise the waitress brought out the wrong cut. She thought I did not my meats, and said,that is your peace. it was not, it was my birthday and I was very sad about this. Because I really wanted to have a cowboy steak. It is one of the most juiciest, most delicious piece of meats.  I have also had the tomahawk ribeye, oh my Lord! Worth every penny! But, it's just me, so I said no this is already big enough. But, it was not. The supervisor offered to change it, I had only taken two bites of it, but it was really rough and tough. Then, they brought me A 14 ounce center cut filet. It was good, but sadly not what I wanted. She was the worst waitress I have ever had at taste of Texas. But not bad for so many years of great service and great food. So, tomorrow we celebrate my oldest so s birthday. I am hoping the same DOES NOT hapoen."
"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!!! Ok so we waited for about 2hours for a table comes to found out, this place is pretty popular! This place is great even if you don't care for steak, (I know, there are some ""TEXANS"" out there that don't like steak, weird right?) there's a great fireplace, waiting area, gift shop and TWO bars. The salad bar alone is to die for. The steaks were juicy and melt in your mouth. The chicken was also delicious. We had a great waitress who made our first experience pleasant. Yes, expect a pretty pricey menu but you honestly get what you pay for."
"Decided to give Taste of Texas another shot after the steak nightmare that was my last visit. I was a little gun shy about ordering a steak, so I got the hamburger. :::::Sigh::::: It was completely void of any flavor. The steak fries were completely under cooked as was my wife's steak. The salad bar was the only highlight, again. We didn't send anything back, didn't even say anything about the problems with the meal, it just wasn't worth the drama. I guess this place just isn't for me. After the meal, I was taking a photo (with my phone) of the logo on the steak knife, it looks like The Alamo. Our waiter started to clear the table, and tried to jerk the knife out of my hand, while I was clearly trying to take a photo. I told him he could have it in just a second, when he ever so politely told me the knives were available for purchase at the front of the restaurant. Thanks for thinking I was going to steal your knife, and making me feel like a thief!"
"Try their New York Strip Sirloin. Yes sir...that's an order! It's one of their classic steaks. You can pick your steak from the fridge so choose wisely. When asked, don't be afraid to add lemon pepper seasoning. It will add a nice layer of salty goodness to your steak, nothing harsh. The waiter will recommend a wine pairing. Trust them. They won't do you wrong. If you have room and feeling festive try some of their dessert. Any dessert item is exceptional. A meal here will make good memories."
"If you want you can choose your cut and steak in the back ask your server! For special events like birthdays they will take a picture of you and give you a printed copy! Texas Au gratin potatoes:-very cheesy and buttery Cream brûlée -love it! No lemon or tart taste, creamy, fresh, smooth under the layer of caramelized sugarSnickers cake I think? -delicious, and looks amazing Steak-highly suggest you choose what you want in the back! So you can choose how much fat you have. Of course you have to have fat for flavor! Salad bar is awesome!"
"Nothing better than this place! They have a wonderful waiting area with free popcorn and soda and a bar! It is always busy so be aware! When they flash your number on the illuminated signs threw out the area you go to the desk and they take you there. (If you are 16 you are still put in the kids area, thats why its 4 stars). There food is amazing and A++ quality servers, if you have little ones they will take them back into the kitchen to see food prepared and to pick out their steak. Once dessert comes they take a plate of every dessert on it to your table! All desserts are wonderful but i must recommend snickers cheese cake or the 'slice of heaven.' It is a restaurant like no other and truly deserves its rating!"
"I was in town for a wedding & came here per recommendation of some friends of family who are locals. Safe to say, I was not disappointed!Atmosphere: The restaurant was relatively large with dim lighting in the dining area. I noticed some people had to use a flashlight on their phone in order to read the menu. The decor, however, was nice & really made you feel like you were in Texas. Although I think the restaurant's intent was to lean slightly more towards the formal side as far as dress goes, the majority of people were in casual/business casual dress.Food: AMAZING! I ordered the 38 oz. tomahawk ribeye (medium rare) & it was cooked perfectly! Once you figure out what steak you want to order on the menu, the waiter invites you into the front of the kitchen to hand pick which steak you'd like them to cook for you. More fat? Less fat? It's all up to you!  The all you can eat salad bar had many options as well as unlimited rolls, jalapeño cornbread, etc. The complimentary cinnamon coffee was great too! The only downside was that I ordered regular fries, but they ended up serving me lukewarm sweet potato fries, so I just went with it.Service: Excellent! Our waiter was polite, answered all our questions sufficiently, & checked on us frequently. The steak came out fast! I was pleasantly surprised when the manager came & introduced himself to us while making sure that everything was satisfactory.Overall: 4.5/5I hate to be the guy that complains about the price, but I personally think everything was slightly overpriced (our 38 oz. steak including a 2 foot long bone was $60). But it could have something to do with the fact that there was an all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse right down the road for $47.99/person. Also, our order was mixed up. Nevertheless, I'd definitely come visit again & would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a massive, perfectly cooked steak (& who can afford it)!"
"Since Texas is known for their steaks, it was only proper that steak would be my first meal in Texas.Be prepared to wait.  Our party of two waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday at about 8pm.  You're given a number when you check in with the hostess.  Pay attention to the screen.  It displays your number, but it's not called out.  On the plus side, check out their waiting area by the bar.  There are complimentary soft drinks, chips and salsa and popcorn to enjoy while you wait.My girlfriend and I split the stuffed mushroom caps (6 pieces, $13.95) for an appetizer.  The mushrooms were stuffed with crabmeat and topped with brie.  Delicious and a recommended starter.  I'm not much of a red meat eater so I went with the 6oz center cut filet ($37.95) mainly because of the size (their steaks come as big as 38 oz).  I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect.  It was served on a silver cow plate and topped with garlic butter.  What's nice is that you're given the option of going to the kitchen and picking out your choice of meat.  That way you can pick a slab with the marbling of your choice.Included with the steaks is a side and their salad bar.  The salad bar had an assortment of salad, fruit, and bread options.  Nothing too special about it in my opinion.  For my side, I went with the asparagus with hollandaise sauce (4 pieces).  Being that I opted for the smaller cut of meat, I ordered the side of steamed lobster tail ($19.95).  It was cooked perfectly and served with a side of melted butter.  It was the perfect amount of food for me, but not enough room for dessert.  Service was good.  Our server was friendly and kept our glasses of wine coming.  Entrees were served in a syncronized manner."
"I am absolutely blown away by Shawn's service. I had been looking at houses all day long and had already gone to the gym, needless to say I was not dressed up to eat lunch but was very hungry. He treated me like I was somebody important to him. No, I didn't order the most expensive item on the menu. I just had a wonderful lunch with my daughter who I never get to spend time with. Thank you so much Shawn for giving me such great customer service. I will definitely be back."
"Ridiculously expensive. $20 for two beers with tax and tip. The salad bar is ""included"" which basically means it's priced into the cost of you steak.The steak was good, but contrary to the opinion of other reviewers, they are not cooked correctly. There are grill marks - for show. What makes a good steak is a nice, dark, browned, crispy exterior, the ""maillard reactions"" (browning, carmelization) that makes grilled, fried, or otherwise browned foods so good. This is true whether the steak is rare, or well-done - the exterior should always have a nice dark crust. These steaks had very little of that, just grill marks, despite being served on a hot metal plate shaped like a cow that I guess is supposed to keep the steak warm and imply that it's sizzling hot. It is not, however, hot enough to crisp the exterior, and only hot enough to continue cooking the interior of the steak to the desired internal temperature.This seems like a place for families and non-foodies to have a ""fancy"" dinner. The salad bar was good. But the price for what I ate was just outrageous. I've been to good restaurants where I could have gotten two steak dinners, with a better cooked steak, for the price that I paid for this one dinner."
"My entire family loves The Taste of Texas!!  We are comfortable bringing our three-year-old into the restaurant. She enjoys the popcorn while we're waiting, coloring on the menu and lots of visual items around the restaurant to play I spy.  Our favorites are the T-bone steak, bacon jam brussels sprouts, salad bar, hamburger, Snickers pie, ice cream sundae.  GO HUNGRY!!"
"Is the steak worth the wait? Some will disagree, but to me it's not worth the trouble of finding parking and then waiting an additional 90-120 minutes just to be seated. By the time you leave your house and your steak arrives, you could have driven to HEB, purchased an expensive USDA prime cut beef, lit some candles, took a bubble bath, grilled your steak, eaten it, and then watched an entire episode of Breaking Bad while indulging in an ice cream sandwich for half the cost. You can't avoid this wait time either by trying to make reservations because they don't accept any! (Having no reservations is more cost effective for restaurants since there are less empty tables. The less empty tables, the more money that flows in). Granted, your wait time may be quicker on less busier nights or with a smaller party. When I went with a party of 8, we ended up waiting almost two hours. Sure we munched on the free chips, salsa, popcorn, soda, but in the end we started eating at 9:00 PM which is pretty darn late for dinner in my book. Not to mention, it's not healthy to eat large portions and heavy meals late in the day. Perhaps it was just a busy Friday night and the entire city decided to eat steak when I went. If you do go, just make it there way earlier than when you plan on eating.The good news is that once you have ordered, the salad bar is all yours to feast upon. The salad bar offers a colorful array of fruits, vegetables, and cheeses (the cheese block is huge!) for anyone who enjoys eating healthy or just want to feel less guilty for later. The funny thing is that my favorite items from the  salad bar are the freshly baked rolls and corn breads. Delicious! As for steaks, I ordered the T-Bone steak for $47.95. As the menu describes, it's ""twenty ounces of the classic combination of filet and New York strip. Well-trimmed and aged 'bone-in' for flavor and tenderness"". After ordering, we were led to the back room where we got to choose our cuts of meat by stabbing it with a pin and tag. The steak came out just the way I wanted which was medium rare. Delicious piece of meat, cooked well, juicy, tender, and more than what I could eat in one sitting. I took the rest home for later and even brought the giant bone with me to give to a dog. Service is generally good here, but we have had rookie waiters/waitresses before. They usually offer nice wines to pair with steaks, speak professionally, and are tentative. Would I choose to dine here again? No, but if someone else was paying or friend/family wanted to go, then sure. The wait is not worth my time. Other than that, Taste of Texas offers great food and service at a fancy price."
"I always thought of Taste of Texas as being way too expensive to ever eat at.We decided to hit it up for lunch, thinking the lunch menu would be cheaper.Nope..no lunch menu.  Just as expensive as ever.So I opted for the smallest cut of prime rib (which was still ~$30).The salad bar trip the meal comes with is awesome.  Don't forget to get rolls/bread/butter/etc.The prime rib was good, but I've had prime rib at a lot of places and it did not make me feel it was so much better than any other place I've had it for (for $~10-$15 less).The service on the other hand was really annoying.Upon walking in there was almost literally a wall of 20+ servers waiting for people to come into the restaurant to be served.  This is great and all, but I don't want to see them all, go hide somewhere.  I don't like feeling like I'm having to say excuse me to employees when walking into a restaurant.After were seated, no less than 4 different people came to the table to greet, or drop off, or rearrange something on the table in the first five minutes we were there.After placing our order and sitting back down from our salad bar excursion, we were interrupted by people ""just checking"" on us, no less than once every 5 minutes.  Seriously.  This is too much.  Between conversation being interrupted constantly to having to answer different people about if we needed more water or something was just too much.I know it sounds like I'm complaining we got too much service, which is not the case, we were simply bugged in between getting good service.  Way annoying.I know someone is going to say I should have tried a $100 steak or something to have really gotten the experience, but the fact is for two people eating the smallest cut of prime rib, mid-day at lunch it still cost $115.  So...I still think I should have really felt impressed and awed by the food at the price, and instead left wondering what all the fuss is about."
"Excellent ""family"" steals house but believe me, this is not the Ponderosa that my own family went to growing up! Not so cheap. Much better steaks. And really good salad bar. Done. I did see a lot of families with little kids dining  which begs the question: how do they pay for this?? LOL."
"WOW.  Just wow... we waited roughly 2 hours to get seated... (i don't know if i'll wait for that long again, but the time went by fairly quickly)  Please note that this place does not take reservations.  However, while waiting they have soda, chips/salsa, popcorn and sometimes appetizers for people waiting... all for free!while waiting, grab a menu and look over what you're going to order so when you get seated you can order asap.  after getting seated, i asked them if i could order the ribeye.  the cool thing about the ribeye is that, you get to go back into the kitchen and pick your meat.  the ribeye is 16oz minimum and its 2.35 per oz... after 24 oz it goes down to a buck every oz after 24.  you get to pick if you want your steak lean cut or marbleized.   very cool that you get to watch them cut and tag your steak.if you order an entree, it comes with a salad bar... (if you just want the salad bar by itself, i believe its about 10 bucks).  the salad bar is legit.  lots of fresh veggies and lots of different dressings to pick from.  there's also a block of cheese you get to pick at.  and not to mention the bread!  the bread with the different types of butter are to die for!the steak took about 20 mins to come out.  and when it did, it looked like a beast. i ordered a 23 oz steak and when it came out, it looked like a beast.  i asked for medium rare and it came out just perfect.  the lemon garlic butter was on point.  the steak was juicy and tender.  the steak also came with 1 side.  i opted for the potato au gratin.  very delicious choice.  i heard this place has excellent dessert, but by then i was too full to continue. i guess since they have a soda machine on the waiting side, i think soda is free here.parking is a bitch during prime time..."
"So I hit up taste of texas again, and I'm choosing to update my review because my experience wasn't as good as the time before. While the service was phenomenal as is expected of an upscale restaurant, the steak left something to be desired. The ribeye I ordered wasn't seasoned at all besides the blue cheese butter on top - I firmly believe a good steak should have a base of salt and pepper at the least. I felt like I was served a $30 steak for $50 - I suppose I paid for the experience.... which has since worn off."
It was my husband and I's first time here. One word to describe our experience- PHENOMENAL!! JJ was our waiter. He was the absolute best!! Atmosphere is very relaxing. Food is superb!! We will be returning...
"I really enjoyed Taste of Texas, there was nothing that I tried that I didn't enjoy. This is a steakhouse but they serve other items as well. Taste of Texas does not take reservations and gets pretty busy but the wait isn't too long. One of my favorite things about this place is the ambiance and the pick out your own steak option. Although it's a little pricey the dress code is pretty casual and laid back. Bring your appetite and give them a try, you won't regret it"
"Even though I am not a huge meat eater, I always enjoy my visits to Taste of Texas. They are on the pricey side but it's a nice location to celebrate those special occasions with loved ones. In fact, I was first introduced to this place a few months back because of a friend's birthday dinner. But I have made several returns to ToT ever since because their salad bar was pretty impressive and watching my friend try to finish a 48 oz steak added to my night's entertainment as well.During my last visit I decided to try their soup and salad bar option and being that I am typically not a fan of soups, their Baked Potato Soup is a must try! It was rich, creamy, and it changed my mind about soups. I have also tried their steaks before and I like that they allow their customers to go pick out their cut of meat. The ribeye by the ounce that I ordered that night was accompanied by a side of a grilled Portobello mushroom. However, I was not a huge fan of the mushroom. In addition, while you are waiting for your table to be ready...I love that this establishment offers snacks (i.e., popcorn and chips with salsa) and soda to make the wait time go faster. (Nobody wants to deal with a hangry customer!!). They have a lounge area with a bar, but it usually fills up pretty quickly. Their staff offers great customer service and are always pleasant.  I can't wait to go back to Taste of Texas to try the other items on the menu that they have to offer. :)"
"Over priced is my concern. Food is good, but not $50 worth good. To me, for $50 per person, they could do better."
"My husband and I are visiting from NY. We are very hard to impress and this place certainly did it. Unbelievably friendly and knowledgeable waiter recommended perfect choice of steak and wine. Portions are huge. Steak was perfectly done. Unfortunately did not have any room left for desert,  have to go back ."
"Old school steakhouse with an awesome atmosphere and delicious steaks. I always enjoy coming here and being treated like a king by the excellent waitstaff. With a massive salad bar, all you can eat fresh bread, and very generous portions of food, if you leave here hungry, that is on you. The only drawback is the wait can exceed an hour at times and they do not accept reservations."
"Where should I begin! By far the best Steak house in Houston.  I love the ambiance and the atmosphere. I ordered the New York Strip , Oscar Style with spinach. Steak was excellent and not over cooked. I can't forget the salad bar and for dessert, we had the snicker cheesecake. It meal was well worth the $200 I spent. I plan to go back in the coming weeks."
"My mother and I dined here one day during the week. Soon after they opened it seemed they were immediately swamped as we went during lunch hours. I believe it may be best to make reservations prior to arriving otherwise you may have to wait, especially if its a large party. We both ordered the pecan crusted grilled chicken, which was stuffed with spinach and came with green beans and rice pilaf. It also came with a salad and complimentary rolls. The salad bar is a 'fix it yourself'. Everything was fresh and neatly put. The food was amazing, the salad was amazing and the service was superb. Our serve was great also! In fact, after we finished eating the manager came out to shake our hands and see how much we enjoyed our meals. Very kind and rare. This is hidden gem that our city is blessed to have. I would definitely return!"
"So after much discussion and picture viewing of the steaks here, I decided it was time to pay a visit again! I went here when I was in high school, which meant I didn't know better on what to get, and I probably got the cheapest thing here. This trip, I splurged a little because of a birthday occasion. (Complimentary dessert for special occasions!)-Wait time: Wasn't bad on a Friday night around 7pm. The wait was 30-40 mins and we had drinks at the bar with their complimentary popcorn, chips and sodas.-Service: Our waiter, Michael, was a sweet heart! He definitely was the realest of the real when it came to really enduring our experience. From encouraging us to at least visit the meat area to pick our cut since it was my boyfriend's first time, to no shame in asking for to-go boxes, even for our leftover bread! Entrees come with an all you can eat, which was awesome, but I didn't want to fill up on it.STEAKS: -Cowboy: This steak was huge...I picked the cut that had a medium amount of marble. I ordered medium rare - rare, since I feel the medium rare is too cooked while the rare isn't cooked enough. Man...I don't usually eat the fat on my steak...but it was to die for. Did I mention I also got garlic butter on it? The amount they gave me was amazing...I almost wished I had more because it was heavenly. I don't think I'm a steak snob, so my opinion on the meat itself isn't very knowledgeable, but I'll tell you that butter and steak combo= excellent. -Tomahawk: This steak was massive and a beauty to look at. The boyfriend got his steak medium rare with lemon pepper and garlic butter. I wished they put more garlic butter on his, but I had some to spare so I gave him some of mine. Again, we are not steak snobs, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. Sides:-Mac and Cheese: This was probably the most below averaged mac and cheese I have ever had. Usually steak venues have amazing mac and cheese...I can almost say that the mac and cheese that use to be served in my high school cafeteria was better than this mac and cheese. DON'T GET IT.-Steak Fries: Nothing special. At all. Dessert:The sample trio: Such a deal. We got key lime pie,  vanilla bean creme brûlée and snicker cheesecake. Desserts were awesome and I advice everyone to try it. Creme Brûlée was my favorite. Overall, besides the sides being a huge disappointment, steaks were delicious. Would I come back? Yes, for a special occasion I definitely would! I was recommended some other entrees that I will definitely look into."
"Tomahawk Ribeye was so normal. The steak was under seasoned. The asparagus with hollendaise sauce was also under seasoned. The meat itself was good, perfectly cooked med rare. No wow factor."
The service is awesome.  Everyone is so nice and very helpful. Our waiter was amazing.  My husband and I ordered the New York Strip. This was our first time here and  we had high expectations of this place.  We were so disappointed.  The steaks we not all that great and the sides were not all that tasty either.  Safe to say we will never be back again
Always gotten the tomahawk.  Great steaks and awesome salad bar included.  Price and service are excellent for what you get as well.  Wish they take reservations because this place can be a very long wait especially nights and weekends.
Underwhelmed. Let me explain....I have been wanting to come here for a while and just haven't for one reason or another.  I love eating out but am not a big steak eater even though I do it from time to time. Normally when I go out to eat my first or second or third thought is not where can I go for a good steak. An opportunity presented itself last week that made me think of going here and I did. It was a Tuesday night and was pleased that the wait for a table was only about 5 minutes because I had read other reviews about waiting...I like the decor of this place. It looks like a Texas steakhouse and is nicely decorated in that vein. After reviewing the menu and even though they offer other entrees than steak I decided to go with the NY Strip with a side of mushrooms. Looking forward to the salad I was very pleased with what I saw and ate. It is one of the better salad bars that I have visited in a while with all of the extras that you would want (5). Also their bread options were very good too. I really liked the salad and bread. About 15-20 minutes after ordering the steak and shrooms showed up and looked very good. A big 16 oz piece of meat. I started with that first and after eating a couple of bites thought it was average. Actually as I continued to eat it I though that it was a little tough and in some cases extra chewy due to some sinew and or pieces of fat. I hate to say this but the steak underwhelmed me. Had I been at a inexpensive steak house I would have understood but this was a $43 steak and should have been better. I have to give it a 2.5 because a 3 would not be fair for a place like this. The mushrooms were very good with a lot of flavor with a beef accent (4). Also my service was very good and professional (4).As you can see everything was very good or better except for the most important part--the steak. Perhaps I just got unlucky but I have to report what I experienced. That's why I am going to average everything out to a 3.  I would go back one more time for another chance  though i don't know how soon.
"The wait staff, food and atmosphere was fantastic! Definitely returning! Thank you so much for having a high standard for customer service! :-)"
"Don't go on a holiday like valentine or something else unless you ready to wait for more than an hour. It has the best customer service, best steaks for the steak lovers, clean restrooms and so much more. I was satisfied with the whole experience and will be back soon."
This was far and away the best steak of my life! Salad bar was great too. Something special about getting to pick out your steak before they cook it.
"Excellent salad bar, steak, salmon, and desserts!!  We were in town visiting and we're so glad we decided on this steakhouse.  Thanks to yelp, we found this amazing restaurant!!"
"While the restaurant doesn't take reservations, the waiting room with free drinks & snacks made the wait go by fast. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Our table ordered the cowboy & the prime rib. Both were excellent. The salad bar was extremely impressive. Barely had room left for our steak after 2 trips to the salad bar."
"Unfortunately, I am not a meat eater but a Texan friend brought me here just to get a taste of Texas. The service was great! Super friendly waiters. The salmon was OK, but I tasted better at home (PNW). The portions are huge. A nice place to visit if you are visiting Texas. Definitely an experience."
"Hands down, the absolute best!!! The service is wonderful!! The food is incredible!! The salad bar and dessert menu are all made in house and fresh daily!!! My first time coming here and I will certainly be back!!! It's a tad pricey, but the food is very, very,good!"
definitely shoud be the best steakhouse in TX. my sister come to visit me from another country and she said she would come to houston again because of this restaurant. t-bone is my favoriate?so amazing?haha I did not care about the calories...top one recommendation.
"After years of hearing that T of T is the best steak in town I finally made it by for lunch today. Pretty disappointing actually. I had the 10 oz Oscar Filet. The crab meat was delicious. The only real highlight of the meal. The steak was flat out mediocre, maybe even weak. Nothing special - on par with Saltgrass or Texas Land and Cattle frankly, which is sad for a ""best in the city"" steak house.  The potatoes au gratin was lousy.  Almost flavorless. Admittedly I hate onions and wasn't expecting them (don't think it was on the menu, which isn't right). But even just eating the potato and cheese was bland and needed salt to be palatable. I don't mind spending $60+ on a lunch if it's delicious.  This wasn't. The service was just mediocre too. There are a lot of better places to get a steak in Houston. Brenners destroys this place in my experience, on every level, and it's only a mile or two down the road. Hopefully this was just a fluke - I may try it again for dinner some time, but it's pretty unlikely I'll drive past Brenners to get to Taste of Texas."
"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would.My wife and I first came here in 2011. We kept coming back.We just returned for the first time in 3 years but only because we moved away. We happen to be in Houston for a day and so we HAD to have lunch here. It's as great as I remember.I have nothing I can say that is bad. Every single element of a fine restaurant/steakhouse is present and with tons of bravado. It's not a cheap restaurant - but you get what you pay for. And for their dishes I think they are bargains!In about a dozen trips, not a single bad experience. I don't think I've had that good luck with any restaurant anywhere.The food is awesome. The service is great. The ambience is perfect. The portions are too much for my wife and I. What else do you want?!"
No better steak house in Houston. The service is always great. Expensive but worth it. And their desserts are legendary.
"Went there with my parents for my dad's birthday. The salad bar was clean and well prepared with fresh veggies. The bread that they had tasted amazing! We ordered the 14 oz. Ribeye and the New York Strip Sirloin. We asked them to make it medium and steaks were perfectly cooked. I had my New York cooked with garlic butter and it tasted great! Even though we only ordered two steaks to share amongst three people we had left overs because the portions were so big. They gave us a dessert on the house for my dad's birthday, and took complementary pictures. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Overall it was a great experience!"
"It was that time of the year when a gal wants to celebrate her birthday and wanted it all to be a surprise. My fiance did a wonderful job by selecting Taste of Texas. He has been to this restaurant a number of times with his co-workers, but it was my first time and it was all a surprise. As we were pulling up, he said ""we are going to pappadeux for your birthday!"" which I was fine with as well, but he tricked me and he pulled into the Taste of Texas parking lot instead. He asked me to get off and get a number, since he was aware that there was a wait time. I did not expect to wait an hour and thirty minutes to an hour and forty five minutes BUT they have a great waiting area, with complimentary sodas, water, chips & salsa, and popcorn (and a BAR). The outside wait area also had cooling systems, which I thought was very neat. I actually dressed up for my birthday and had a ton of makeup on (lol) so I did not want to wait outside. We decided to wait inside, and have some drinks, okay- only one drink lol (did not want to get too full with alcohol and chips.)We did wait about 1 1/2 hours, but it was worth it. Salad bar was amazing, bread was delicious (about four different types available) and our dinner was great. I have had better steak, BUT it was not bad. It was a ribeye, med-rare. I know my cuts of meat, and I knew it was going to be fatty- but I still enjoyed it, mainly because my fiance went out of his way for me. Taste of Texas gave me my dessert for free, so thank you all for that!  I got the snickers cake, which was topped with a sparkler, that matched my mood :)  Hopefully we will be back soon!"
"I have been coming here all my life and must say this is still one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. You get a great bang for your buck. Their Christmas decorations are up too now and are just simply beautiful. I am writing this review now because I was really blown away by my last dining experience. I felt my cowboy steak was a little undercooked (bf and I were sharing) and the waiter took my half back. I felt when it came back it was now slightly over cooked and the manager said he would get me an entire new 16 oz ribeye steak! I was shocked. And each time my steak (my half) came out, they brought me a new side dish. The staff just went so above and beyond what I would have even imagined to make sure I was happy! They sure know how to make you feel special."
I came here for my father in laws birthday dinner and have never been before. It's a little weird because it reminds me of that Lauberge because it's dark with no windows and everything is pricey. We walked in on a Tuesday night at about 8 oclock and there was no wait. They placed us in a back corner which I guess was good because our family is a little loud. A few of us split meals (huge portions). My husband and I got the tbone with garlic butter. We ordered well done but it was still a little pink. My sister in law's which was also supposed to be well done was VERY pink but we didn't send it back because there was plenty of other food. The salad bar is ok. I wasn't as blown away with it as people on here rave. It reminds me of Jason's Deli to be honest. And the bread warmer is interesting so you get to choose the type of bread and butter/sauce you want. The cheese bread is good but if it cools down then the melted cheese hardens and isn't very apppetizing. The place did take our picture and bring out a free dessert which made the evening nice.This place is fancy but it's more of a special occasion place rather than a every weekend thing. In total for all 6 of us it was $246 (Plus more for tip). It's nice for those who have never been but coming a lot can probably make it lose that charm.
"Took my friend from Switzerland who was visiting, wanted to impress her ""Texas style"" and succeeded!!! Great service, good food and fantastic ambiance. Houstonians have a real representative with this place, all the best flavored of Texas. Huge fan. Will be bringing back all my ""non"" Texas friends. Great great place to impress."
"I have been lucky enough to enjoy this amazing restaurant since I was just a little girl! The owners, managers and all staff are truly exceptional people and make the dining experience incredible.  The food is always delicious.  We actually enjoy the wait on the weekends with free sodas and snacks.  We always run into old friends there and get to catch up while waiting for our table.  Fun time always!"
"Taste of Texas...we'll keep it brief because it really speaks for itself.- Food: Eat steak. Order from the right side of the menu to have unlimited salad bar access and a free side with your steak. I recommend the cowboy steak (about 18 oz of meat) or the ribeye (16 oz minimum, priced by the oz). They were delicious, not ridiculously overpriced like I've had at other high-end steak houses, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. You have the choice of an optional seasoning on each steak as well; the garlic butter was incredible and also entails your steak coming out on a hot platter. You can even go into the back room and pick out the steak you want by looking at the display case and they'll tag it with a number to make sure it gets onto your plate. I tried the brussel sprouts and mushroom sides and they were both excellent.- Service: Phenomenal. Truly. My mom was dining with us and she tends to give waitstaff a hard time but our waiter (I think his name was Anthony) was a true professional. I can't say enough good things about him. I am pretty sure that when I stepped away from the table for a minute, I left my rumpled napkin behind on my chair and when I came back, I found it neatly folded on the table. Not only was he an exceptional waiter, he is also apparently a ninja. - Price: Each steak costs anywhere from $40-60ish. This includes the unlimited salad bar and a side dish. Really quite a deal. The salad bar is stocked full of delicious fancy veggies/nuts, cheeses, breads, and spreads. Oh, and there's complimentary cinnamon coffee (which also happens to be decaf) that everyone should try! It's quite good.If you're from Texas and you've never been to Taste of Texas, please go. You don't regret it...and you'll definitely be craving it for a few weeks afterward."
"BEST IN HOUSTON! I am a native and TOT is a no-brainer for perfection of food, service, menu selection. Yes, it's pricey and often very crowded. There is a reason!! Amazing food quality with stellar service. The Hendee family is a Lord loving family and treat everyone with same welcoming atmosphere. This is the birthday, anniversary, special out of town guest best of the best!!"
"Five stars ! Very good restaurant .This place is very generous, chips and salsa while you wait for a table. Popcorn and free drinks too!Salad bar was top notch, service was great!Now for the steaks! The best steak I have had in a long time. Definitely worth the big price tag."
"This is exactly what my husband and I wanted to find in Texas...a one of a kind Steakhouse that's feels, well, like Texas. We picked out our own steaks and took a picture with the bear and everything. It was very touristy of us. The server was very sweet. The food was very good. The portions were large."
"Went here for my sons 16th Birthday by recommendation of several co-workers. What can I say but absolutely amazing meal. The filet with garlic butter sauce you could cut with a butter knife. Our server Matt, was absolutely attentive to our every need.  Thank you Taste of Texas for making my Sons 16th Birthday dinner so special."
"Weeknights=Excuses...My family eats at Taste of Texas several times a month.  I've found weeknights are generally their weakest performances and tonight proved no different.  The service has been spotty, the food mediocre and inconsistent for the level of expectation, and managements response was on the side of helpless.  If Saltgrass and Outback is your top rung steakhouse experience, this won't ever disappoint.  But if you dine at the city's top steakhouses, Taste of Texas may be slipping from their rank at the top of the list."
"I went to this place years ago when I was a kid. Our family went last Friday and it was a complete blast from the past. So much looked exactly the same. My parents informed me that I used to get the cheeseburger when I was a kid, but I ordered the New York strip this time with the asparagus and au gratin potatoes. I was absolutely impressed. Houston has a reputation for chewing up and spitting out restaurants so for this place to be open and continue to have such high standards after so many years is spectacular. I am sure we won't be allowing so many years to pass between visits again!"
This is my favorite spot to get a good juicy steak! The salad bar is also great. The place is always clean and the workers are very nice!
Best meal in Houston in terms of both food and service quality. We have two people and ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye Steak. It had an impressive appearance: with a long bone hanging off the plate and 38 ounces of meat. The steak is Angus certified which speaks for its supreme quality. The steak was cooked to medium as suggested by the waiter and the taste and texture were just awesome. Highly recommend it to people who Wang to get a taste of steak with quality.
"Took friends from Japan to ToT last night.  I go here about twice a year and am always happy with the experience. My wife enjoys the salad bar and shares the 20 oz Cowboy Ribeye with me.  Most of the time we have leftovers because even knowing how good the steak will be, I cannot skimp on the salad bar.  My friends from Japan had a Filet and a regular sized Ribeye and both made sounds of great enjoyment.  The prices are not bad for a steakhouse of this quality and the experience is far better than at some other, more expensive, places that are considered ""better.""To top off a great meal experience - the staff are all well trained and friendly, the restaurant recognizes birthdays with a nice dessert and my international friends were loaned cowboy hats and given neckerchiefs and sent home with pictures from a great meal and a great experience."
Wow!! Had the t-bone and it was perfectly cooked. Sides. Who needs them by they were wonderful as well. The wrapped quail appetizer is a big recommend!!
"Every now and then someone visits from out of state and wants the Texas steakhouse experience.  You need not look any further than Taste of Texas.They do not take reservations, but that really doesn't matter.  Their bar area is bigger than a lot of restaurants.  There is plenty of room to sit down and enjoy a cocktail while you wait for your table to be ready.  I actually enjoy this more than being ushered straight to a table.When you do get to your table you receive your menu.  You can also get a wine list which comes on an iPad.  I found this interesting, but my guess is this keeps the list really up to date.  We started with the Texas Quail Bites.  You really can't go wrong with bacon wrapped anything, and they were very tasty.  I am not sure I would get an appetizer next time, as the rest of the meal was so big.I ordered the Ribeye steak by the ounce.  It was $2.55 per ounce and I ordered a 20oz steak.  They take you to the back where the butcher area is and let you pick out your steak.  They held up a whole slab of meat and let me pick what I wanted.  It was pretty cool.  If you order a meal the salad bar is free.  This is why I probably would not get an appetizer.  The salad bar was big and lots of options.  You can also make yourself a basket of bread to take back to the table.  Since everything is a la carte, I also ordered some Au Gratin Potatoes.After polishing off the quail and salad my cooked steak and potatoes showed up.  The steak was tender and juicy.  It was well seasoned, and tasty.  I ordered it medium rare, and it was definitely medium.  I didn't mind this and finished every bit of it.  The potatoes were good too, but the hero here really is the steak.  Somehow I managed to order dessert too.  I got the Snickers Pie, which is basically a cheesecake with a big layer of snickers.  I can't believe I managed to eat all of it.  I left Taste of Texas more stuffed then I have been in a long time.  Everything thing I had there was great, and their portions definitely are Texas sized!  The service was friendly and it was a great time.  I will be looking for an excuse to go back!"
"The place was amazing, it was pricey but completely worth itWent for a birthday dinner and was more than worth it The server was amazing and helpful Ordered the salmon and prime ribBoth tasted great and the entrees came with one trip to salad bar which was great We got a complimentary cake on the house for the birthday celebration, they even take your pics with the cake and print it out for you Its a great place with amazing food"
"Love this place! There's usually a long wait but you get popcorn and chips with salsa while you wait. The steak is really good. I love getting it with garlic butter. The manager is usually walking around making sure everyone is happy. I would have given it 5 stars but it lost 1 star because they changed their tradition. For all first timers, they used to take a photo of them in cowboys hats and a bandanna and give them a copy. Last time we went they said they only do it for new international visitors and they don't do the bandana. I felt like this was why I always took out of town visitors here. That and they let  you choose your meat."
"Meat! Vegetarians stay at home. Yes, they do have non-beef dinners but not half as much fun as MEAT! She enjoyed the Prime Rib and I had a 24oz Rib Eye. Very satisfying. Also we did the baked sweet potatoes with cinnamon butter and pecans ... oh yeah, some green beans. After all, we must eat ""healthy"". Had a demi bottle of Duck Horn Cabernet and of course a martini and some quail bites to start the meal. Great service. If you want a bit of piece and quiet away from the main dining room, ask for a table in one of the side dining rooms."
"Great place to go for steaks!Great spot for getting a good quality steak!Salad bar is humongous with plenty to choose from and they have cheeses you slice yourself and breads to choose from. Steaks are amazing and are always consistent in their temperatures. Delicious and definitely will melt in your mouth. Only thing that's a bit of a downer is that they do not take reservations, but they do have a great waiting area with free soft drinks, popcorn and chips & salsa to much on while you wait. But don't get too full off of those! The best part is coming!Desserts.....Oh good god. They have a lot. And they all look delicious! I love Creme Brulee, and that's usually what I go for.Enjoy!"
"Taste of Texas is all about letting you select what you would like to put inside your body. Start with one of the best salad bars I have ever experienced - YOU choose what you want on your salad - all fresh and delicious. Want a steak? YOU get to go back to the kitchen and select the meat you would like the restaurant to cook for you. I love their filet, but the well-marbled Ribeye, T-bone, and Porterhouse are all absolutely amazing. Then, for you bread lovers, they have fresh baked rolls to die for - great with both your meal and salad. Try not to stuff yourself because they also have great appetizers and deserts - love, love love Taste of Texas!!! One last tip - you HAVE to go during the Christmas Season when they decorate the place with thousands of lights and classic Christmas decorations. Great for Special Occasions!!!"
Went there for Father's Day. Outstanding prime rib and my wife's medallions were fantastic. Salad bar is one of the best in Houston. Mimi took great care of us and cant wait to come back. This is a must see if you want a true Texas steak.
"If you plan to eat at Taste of Texas prepare to wait for at least two episodes of American Ninja Warrior! Relax its not that bad..but definitely bring something to keep you occupied! If you're on a date, it's the perfect time to sit by the bar and get to know your gal :)! The restaurant had complimentary soft drinks, chips and salsa, and popcorn in the waiting room which are bombbb. Chips and salsa are my weakness. Most of the entrees come with the salad bar. The salad bar is very nice! Have to get your micros in before the main course. For our entree we ordered the Tomahawk Steak with a side of mashed potatoes and a steamed lobster tail. We also ordered a side of baked potato soup. The tomahawk steak is HUGE. Everything is truly bigger in Texas. It was topped with herb-garlic butter on top cooked perfectly (medium-rare). I honestly believe it can be shared between two or even three. This is personal preference but it is a fatty piece of beef..a little too much marbling for me..I guess I'm not man enough to hang with this steak :( 8/10The lobster  tail was good too. I think it was a little over cooked so it was a little chewy. It came with melted butter kept warm by a candle fire. 7/10The baked potato soup was very thick and hearty! Went down easy and my girlfriend added cheese into the soup which made it cheesy and delicious. My girlfriend thought it was okay but I liked it. 7/10For dessert we picked out the snickers cake which was dangerously sweet but it was delicious. I could imagine my next dentist appointment already bite after bite but I just could not stop!  9/10Overall the service was great, food was good, and it was a great experience. Would come again, great place for celebrating a special occasion, Texas forever, and HOOK EM \m/"
"Well...I want to give this place 5 stars but I just can't. Start from the beginning. This place NEEDS to take reservations. There is no reason on a Saturday night we have to wait two hours. It's STUPID! They give you popcorn and pop while you wait but do you REALLY want to eat or drink that and fill up so you arent hungry for your expensive steak?! The inside of the resturant is dark, dank, uninviting, and slightly creepy. Not what I would expect. Reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory but much worse. The salad bar always has a line and I don't understand why this place doesnt have Italian dressing?? Seriously! Then there's the cheese block...as your standing there struggling to get WARM cheese off a block while there is people behind you waiting to do the same thing giving you dirty looks! They need to hire someone JUST to put cheese on your salad...keep the line moving and save me from blisters! The rolls and butter are good and love how you can take a basket back to your table!! I didnt notice that little perk until our last trip. The service SUCKS! The prime rib I always get medium and is cooked PICTURE PERFECT! Worth every penny! The chocolate cake is AMAZING! Especially with extra chocolate sauce!!! YUMMMMMM! Everytime we come here there is a birthday nearby and the candle/sparkler they use is SO GROSS! The smell makes me want to throw up! GET A NEW KIND OF CANDLE! When I was pregnant I actually had to take a break eating because the smell was TOO much for me. I would like to give this place a 5 star rating but I have ""beef"" with this place. HAHAHA!"
"I loved the waiting area! They don't take reservations, but the waiting area is worth it! Free chips & salsa, popcorn, and soda/water while you wait, with plenty of tables to sit at. There is also a dedicated bar in that area as well.The salad bar was great, as was the food! We got a steak, and it was enough to share. One of my favorite steak houses in Houston!"
"One of my favorite restaurants.  Never had a bad meal there, and service is always good.  It's not cheap, but I would still say that it is one of the better values out there for a good steak house.  The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because they don't take reservations, and there is always at least an hour wait on the weekends."
"I enjoy steak, I love a great tasting steak, so in turn, I love this place.  I have to say, if this place is a ""Taste of Texas"", then these Texans know how to make some good food!  The idea that everything is big in Texas goes well here!  Let me start by saying that while waiting for our table, we were able to help ourselves to some chips with salsa, popcorn, and even fountain soft drinks, which were all complementary!!  What a nice touch.. but also.. a bad way to spoil your appetite.  You want to be hungry for the food here! (Though I couldn't resist the ""free"" because of that ""Asian"" in me!)Once we sat down, I gazed at the menu... specifically the steak page.  They got your styles of sirloin and rib-eye steaks to choose from.  Let me just say that their largest in-menu item steak is called a Tomahawk Ribeye, a 38oz steak made for a caveman!  This steak has a bone which I would say is at least 1 foot, hanging OFF the steak.  So if you were in the Stone Age and had some really strong teeth, you could hold this 38oz steak by the BONE and just eat it without utensils.  Now do I recommend you to do this.. I do not, but if time travel was created and you bring a caveman here, I'm sure he would be happy to eat the steak this way!Another nice touch here is that you can order rib-eye steak by the ounce.  So is a 38oz steak not enough for you?!? Then ORDER MORE!!  Personally for me, a nice 24oz Cowboy steak was my choice.  Also, they give you an option for sauces/seasoning on the steak, and I choose the option of lemon pepper, along with herb butter garlic sauce.  FYI the other option of sauce they have here is a blue cheese butter.  After my friends and I picked our steaks, we were given the option to go to the back and PICK our cuts of steak.  Nice this was a nice touch!  Of course.. I picked one of the fattest cuts, which I did not regret one bit due to the flavorful steak I was about to eat!  After we picked our steaks, we helped ourselves to the unlimited salad bar that comes with my order.  The salad bar was a nice appetizing start to the meal, with some good bread to munch on as well.So once the steak comes, I have to say this was one of the best cuts of steak I've eaten.  The combination of lemon pepper and herb garlic sauce work very well for me, and this steak was just full of flavor, juiciness, and deliciousness!  There is not enough descriptive words I can say about this steak.  In essence, it was just, GREAT!  I was also able to get a bide of my friend's Tomahawk steaks, which were also great as well.  There was a point during dinner that all my friends and I were just so quiet at the table due to all of us enjoying the steaks!If you can take the prices here (it is a high-end, pricy place), then definitely check out Taste of Texas.  I also noticed they asked us if anyone was from out of the country visiting.  Apparently, if you are visiting from another country, they dress you up with a cowboy hat to show everyone you are a foreigner.  In addition, if they have it, they will provide you with a menu in your home-language, which is a very nice souvenir to have, so you can remember that cut of steak you ate.. that GOOD cut of steak!"
"I have enjoyed eating here for many years.  We were customers before they even moved to this location. However while dining there in mid December we were celebrating two friends birthdays which we have done several times there.  The waiter, and I wish I could remember his name, kept asking questions about their birthdays.  After we received the bill and we were charged for 2 usually complimentary birthday desserts, I asked him why and he said the birthday policy was they needed to be within two weeks.  My complaint is he never told us that, never confirmed the actual date of the birthdays and should not have charged and additional $20 without communicating that.  As to not make a scene with my friends, I paid the bill and left.  My history of lovely meals at T. of T. is done."
"Taste of Texas is overwhelmingly incredible. This is more than a restaurant. I truly felt I was at Disneyland. It's Big Thunder Ranch with a great salad bar and amazing steaks. The service, food and overall experience exude happiness. I can't wait to return."
"Not sure what I could say that hasn't been said already. Service: always amazing and attentive. Great recommendations and never pushy. Food: Um, duh. It's why you come! Make sure to be really hungry though. I tend to fill up on the salad bar because it's amazing. There's also a few bread choices, some cheese blocks you can shave yourself.Atmosphere: You're definitely in Texas. I haven't had the opportunity to come during Christmas to see the decorations, but it's a nice large space so you don't feel crowded. Make sure to let them know it's your first time there, they'll take you to the back to choose your own steak. Even if it's not your first time, you'll be able to go back there if you want. They also don't take reservations but this hasn't ever been an issue. I've come by with a large group for lunch before and we had to wait possibly 5-10 minutes. Otherwise, we've always been seated immediately."
"Fantastic food and service -- can't get any better than this!Juicy, tender steaks cooked to perfection, and incredible salad bar, great appetizers (quail skewers, crab cakes, stuffed shrimp, and more), and the best deserts!  Finish it off with cappuccino!"
"I don't even like steak, but even I get excited about a trip to Taste of Texas!  My boyfriend loves steak in general, so I begrudgingly tried TOT with him a few months ago.  It goes without saying that the steak is delicious, but the salad and bread bar is what really sold me.  They have lots of fresh options on the bar and the honey, cinnamon butter that you get with the fresh bread is ADDICTIVE!  Don't leave without trying it.Other recommendations:  Jalapeno Stuffed Shrimp and the Ribeye or Center Cut Filet with Lemon Pepper Seasoning.Warning: They do not take reservations, so you may end up waiting an hour if you come in during the weekend.  That being said, they have an entire waiting area with a bar, popcorn, and self-serve chips and salsa to make the wait bearable."
"How anyone could rate this restaurant with any less than 4 Stars confounds me. I have given it a 5 on this particular occasion because after being seated and waiting 10 minutes for water or a server the manager (at our behest) stepped in and began to act as a server until he could get coverage for our table. He later comp'd us desserts on top of his attentiveness. We had been seated just as the restaurant was beginning service (it was about 5:15 PM) hence either the waiter did not understand he had our table or he had simply not yet been assigned. In any case when he showed up and took over for the manager he continued the incredible service. Let me however step back for a moment and begin to describe the meal which for me started with a very dry martini which was excellent. The salad bar was typically stocked with a variety of fresh vegetables and toppings as well as cheese and my personal favorite Jalapeno Corn Bread. Because we were an early seating we did not suffer from the oftentimes long wait which is as a result of the quality and service of this restaurant. Although the wait can be detracting from the experience, if you take into consideration why it occurs (because the steaks are amazing) it's popularity is really not reason to be critical of the restaurant. Make it a point to leave work early or get there at 5:00 PM and that problem goes away. Now onto my Cowboy Ribeye, rare...it was perfect. Cooked perfectly, well marbled, just the proper amount of char which I have made every attempt to duplicate for about 20 years or more, moist and hot. This is clearly my favorite steak and of all the steak restaurants I have gone to is probably one of the best. Mushrooms were my chosen vegetable and coffee topped off the meal although my guests had desserts compliment of the manager. Given yesterday evenings service and the steak which is always dependable, of high quality and well portioned for the cost I had to give the experience 5 Stars."
"I ate here today (8-25-16).  The service was great.  The salad bar was great.   I ordered the grilled tuna, which I know is kind of weird to get at a steak place.  It was served a bit overdone for me; however I'm not the type to send stuff back so I ate it, and for the most part, enjoyed it anyway.  My biggest complaint is that it was very obvious that the lemon placed in my glass of water was cut with the same knife that was used to slice onions because my water, as well as everyone's water or tea (any drink with a lemon) at our table had a very strong onion smell and taste.  I like onions, just not in my drinks.  After figuring that out, I couldn't help but wonder what other shortcuts are happening in the kitchen.  I really expect more from a place that is as pricey as this place is."
"We came here to celebrate my birthday during our Texas trip in March. The overall experience was pleasant, from the refreshment at waiting area, to free salad and the service. We were invited to the kitchen and choose our steak, which was a nice touch. However, the steaks did not wow me. Both of us ordered rib eyes, one medium rare and the other medium. They tasted not much different from the ones you would order at somewhere like Texas Roadhouse. Our friend  recommended Taste of Texas as if it's THE place to eat steak but I was left unimpressed."
It is worth every dollar! Leftover steak is good for at least 2 reheats in the microwave - still tender and juicy! And those asiago cheese rolls!!!
Really over priced for the quality of steak I recieved. Tough and full of grisle.  I was Soulja disappointed.  Very cold in resturant and this caused my food (potatoes) to get cold fast.   Not sure I'm up to try it again.
"The three stars are based on past visits.  I didn't want to lower the overall rating based on one experience as most times I would rate Taste of Texas 5+ stars....That being said tonight's experience was more like a 1 star. I'm not going to complain about the wait or price, as both are fine for the environment and do not reflect the rating for me. Tonight my husband and I went out to celebrate my birthday. My filet was delicious, cooked perfectly medium/well. My husband ordered the 16oz NY strip, well done, also stated he wanted it grey all the way through. Try #1, medium. Try #2, medium/well(ish). The manager was very polite and understanding (Norman) as was the waitress. They offered to start a new steak, which my husband was happy to hear at that point-as a third attempt would most likely mean a rubbery steak. (Well done steak can be cooked juicy if done right-as he has had the same steak cooked the same way several times there)  Try #3, medium-blood pooling on top and on the bottom of the steak. That killed his appetite and he just asked for the check. The manager assured him the meal was on him and to order a desert.  My husband asked for it to go as he could not eat after the 3 attempts at his meal had failed. Our evening away from kids was pretty much a loss, while the wait was the best part of the evening. Of course my husband did not pay for his meal, as he should not have-he did not eat it, and waited for 3 attempts to cook his steak properly. We did pay for my meal, which honestly at that point I think wasn't very good customer service. We use to frequent Taste of Texas somewhat often, but I am not sure when/if my husband will want to return his business there."
Fantastic place to take newbies to the city! True Texas dining large delicious portions and friendly warm service must try the bread and cornbread! Tasty tasty!
We came here for our chrismas company party and let me tell you this plase is AWSOME. Its expensive but awsome. From the atmosphere in the restaurant to the service we received. The waitress was really attentive and anwer any question we had. They have a salad bar and their bread. What i love also was their diffrent tyoe of desert . Just great food
"I haven't been here in over a year, and we used to frequent this place more often. I don't what changed but today we were taking one of our co workers to lunch before he gets married this weekend.Our HR person had called ahead and reserved he tables as we had 9 people that were going to be attending.The service was excellent, our waiter's name was Corey and he was on point. He took care of us from the time we walked in to the time we left. We all mostly ordered the salad bar, which is excellent and soup. Corey did not screw up our orders and he made sure that we had adequate amounts of ice tea, water and lemons on our table. He even let us do separate tickets, I know that must have been a headache for him but I think he got a larger tip because of his service. I will have to put them back into m y lunch rotation."
"We celebrated our wedding anniversary this week by going to Taste of Texas.  We had heard nothing but great things about it so decided to finally try it. I was for-warned to get there early because it gets packed.  We got there at 4:40pm and our wait time was like 15 min.  However, when we were finally leaving there looked like there was well over 50 people waiting for a table.If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.  I had the Cowboy Ribeye steak cooked medium.  They had 3 choices of ways to cook your steak: garlic butter, blue cheese, and lemon pepper.  We went with the garlic butter and when I say this was the best steak I've ever had, I completely mean it.  The flavor was amazing, it was cooked perfectly, and it was huge!!!! 24 oz to be exact!  I pretty much had 2 meals off that 1 steak (leftovers).  With purchase of the steak we got a free trip to the salad bar.  There was nothing too amazing about it but that didn't take away from the experience. I will say that I really enjoyed the jalapeno corn bread and the dinner rolls with the cinnamon butter.  They had some type of cheese bread that looks like a cinnamon roll that was not good at all. It must be an acquired taste that I clearly have not acquired. We also ordered an appetizer of Quail bites that came with Jalapeno poppers.  The entire thing was delicious!  The bbq sauce was amazing!!To my surprise before we got our tab, our waitress came out with a tray of desserts and asked us which one we wanted.  She said because it was our anniversary, they were going to give us our choice of any dessert on the house.  She also took a picture of my husband and I when our dessert came out and gave us a copy of it in a card with the Taste of Texas's logo on it.  I was thoroughly impressed.Everything we ordered came out to about $135 for 2 steaks and an appetizer and 2 drinks.  That wasn't bad at all.  I will definitely be back.  I LOVED TASTE OF TEXAS!!!"
"This place is phenomenal!!! The food is to die for and the service is amazing! Everyone is so polite. Our server delivered the best service we have ever received. I got the single cut filet 6oz with asparagus the salad bar. We also order the slice of heaven for dessert! Our waiters name was Mike F. Definitely the best service we have ever had, we will definitely be returning. The food is worth the money by far!!!"
Everyone should try this place at least once or twenty times.  The steak is always cooked perfectly and the salad bar is top notch. And the service is consistently great!
"This place is second to none!  Got the 16oz NY strip w asparagus and hollandaise sauce.   The salad bar rocks!  Hand crumbled fresh bacon, I think I must have eaten the equivalent of 8 pieces w other amazing toppings.When you arrive have plenty of money in your pocket, it is worth it."
"Although the wait is long, it is definitely worth it! The steak was perfectly cooked and it was juicy inside. I personally love the Tomahawk Ribeye Steak the most."
Amazing restaurant experience here.  Crab cakes were the best I've ever had! Get the desserts- you will not regret it.Erin was one of the best servers I've had.  Thank you Erin for being so attentive and giving us a one of a kind experience.  Love this restaurant!
"Waiting for a table took about 2 hours, which is fine except when the food is mediocre at best."
"Hey there Cowgirls and Cowboys, you might want to saddle up and head over here....this isn't just a ordinary steakhouse, this is THE STEAKHOUSE!!! For first timers expect to be offered a big ole' Stetson and a bandana, and make sure that when they ask you to pick out your steak you accept........just follow me your waiter will say......A few steps across the dining room, and the beautiful smell hits you like a Chuck Norris Fist.  POW!  This is a man cave disguised as a restaurant.  I can feel the testosterone flowing through the floorboards.  ...So now your feeling a bit strange as your waiter has taken you in the back of the building and into the kitchen.  Inside a counter is set up and you can select your specific steak.  I was having a ribeye, so I was shown a handful of sides of beef and selected the marbling of my choice.  He cut it perfectly to my specifications.  A silver tag was clipped to my steak #61.  I was told when it arrives at the table to make sure it was the steak with my number.  I asked for it with Garlic butter and it arrived sizzling on a iron plate.  It was cooked to perfection and a side dish of au gratin potatoes finished me off.  I can do this, I can do this.... Come on man! Eat!  The Duke never took home a doggie bag!!!! Don't even think about looking at that dessert tray unless you are a grizzled veteran or a competitive eater.....this is my advice.  I had the handmade ice cream sunday and I feel like I need to upgrade my seat as I write this on the plane home....Texans really know how to eat.This is a must stop in Houston."
"Usually, I bring the guests from other states, countries there. Today was a family event and the food and the service was excellent. Really appreciate Tina for the wonderful service!"
"It's not as if Taste of Texas really needs another 5 star review but they definitely do deserve it.  The only thing that bugged me is that they don't take reservations and the wait was about 1.5 hours for a party of 2 on a Saturday evening.  Aside from that, service is impeccable. The salad bar here is so so. Just a regular salad bar with nothing special. The cinnamon butter for bread is so delicious!  Let's get to what really matters-- the meat!  I had the porterhouse steak medium rare with garlic butter. So good and so much flavor!  Portions are obviously huge. I definitely had leftovers. My boyfriend had the tomahawk which was very flavorful but we both agreed the porterhouse was the winner. I would definitely come back here. I like that it's a delicious steakhouse with a more casual ambiance. I wouldn't feel underdressed if I came here in jeans with a nice top and the fellas can do the same."
"Love this place. I can't believe I am just now reviewing it! It never disappoints. I usually get the center cut filet Oscar style which is when they put crab lumps on top with béarnaise sauce. My dad had the cowboy steak. 24 oz of juicy deliciousness. Oh. My. Goodness. And you get a salad bar with your meal which is to die for. It is so huge and such great selections including a section where you can shave off slices of cheese from a huge block! The first time I came here I could have died! Then they bring out this dessert tray display that just takes you over the edge because it all looks so great and it tastes good too. The price is higher than your average steakhouse but the portion sizes, quality, and customer service are worth the money. Trust me, it's in the top three steakhouse restaurants in Houston I have found. Some of the others may be more fancy but this is the real deal!Perfect for taking visiting friends and family members to give them a real ""taste of Texas""!"
"Best steak in town. The price is reasonable. Salad bar is awesome . Cheese, free fruits, crispy greens and endless of toppings  I love the corn breads. Deserts also are so good. This is one of the best steak house, the service is so wonderful. Nice thing about this restaurant is that you can dress casual and enjoy your diner. Would come back again."
"Aside from their great food and attention, they have the best salad bar in town."
"I love this Texan steakhouse. It's not too fancy where you feel like you must dress up to enjoy your dinner here, and even if you're dressed a little down you don't feel out of place. but its great quality. This is one of my favorite places to get steak here in Houston. We always have a great dinner experience here. Arrived at 9:30PM for dinner last night (they close at 10) and not once did we feel rushed through dinner. Our waiter Jason was very attentive, but not buggin through dinner. We ordered dessert around 10:30PM and he did not make us feel like he was in a rush to go home. I ordered the 6oz center cut filet topped with garlic herb butter. It was delicious. So tender & flavorful! The Atlantic salmon is a very great portion size.. my boyfriend ordered that since he doesn't steak much and he said it was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend starting with the grilled quail! All entrees come with the salad bar which was awesomeeee!"
Had my birthday lunch here on 5/21. Carlos was our waiter. The service was wonderful. Never had to ask for refills on our drinks. Table was cleared without being intrusive. Our food was delicious. Carlos took a group picture of us and then returned later with the 2 copies of the printed picture for me to keep. I loved it!
Steak was great ambiance and atmosphere was not .Definitely not worth the price  feels like Golden Corral a do it yourself salad bar at a supposedly upscale pricey restaurant  just feels so strange .  The steak though was pretty great !
"One of the best steaks I have ever had in Houston. Fun atmosphere and although it is high class and quality, it isn't stuffy. Great experience and I guarantee I will have many more here to come!!"
"I've been here twice, once when I was much younger and again just a few days ago for my brother's graduation. We arrived at nearly 9PM and didn't eat till 10 (thanks to poor planning by the group). I was exhausted & ready to really just hate that we were here. But I had a good time anyway. The very long wait doesn't seem long at all in the large & exceptionally nice waiting room with free sodas, chips & salsa, & popcorn. There is also a bar where you can order drinks there.The steak was excellent & flavorful (I got the New York Strip) and my baked potato was good. My mother among others rave about the salad bar excessively, while it is a good salad bar with many choices, it's not that exceptional. Salad was crisp and fresh, the bacon bits are actually real chunks of bacon. There are giant bricks of cheese that you can slice pieces off of, but there is no grater which makes it largely useless for salad unless you can crumble chunks yourself.Also, the waitress spent WAY too much time trying to sell appetizers and explaining the easy-to-understand menu. I'm sure it was required for her to do but it just took up time and not really applicable to a large 9+ person group. The place is also extremely dark, the older folks in our group had to bring out the cellphone flashlights just to read the menu.Overall, I would visit again, but probably just with my fiancee at a reasonable hour and not a large group at 9PM"
"Went here after church with my mom and a friend girl. Salad bar was good but it seems like they have scaled it back some. We had the most rudest server ever. He asked my friend only if she would like some wine as if my mom and I were invisible. I hate complaining about my food but I had the sliders and the were dry so I sent it back. And the manager was very nice about it.  But in the end the server charged me 32$ for something I didn't have in addition to what I did have. Then comes back to the table and says oh it'll take 2-3 business days to go back to your account. Then throws his business card down and says if you have any problem call me.  I was livid by the end of the night. Uhhhh I hate bad service and this was horrible. My friend, my mom and I were in disbelief about the incredibly bad service. Luckily I just came from church so I'm just gonna pray for him and ask GOD to have favor over the situation. But my goodness I have never.......??"
"The absolute best steak I've ever had.   When I was done I almost cried because I wish I had more.  The tomahawk is killer and it comes out on a silver platter covered in a garlic herb butter seared with a perfect char.  It comes with a trip to the salad bar and a side.  I was feeling brave so I added the quail skewers and they were good, but the steak is the true hero here.  Great atmosphere and a must go if your visiting West Houston."
"I was willing to give them a two star review, but after the way my boyfriend and his sister were treated, (including my overall experience) I decided there had to be better options out there.If we look at the positives the novelty of choosing your own steak, the salad bar, the waiting room (which I didn't experience) and the clientele make it an interesting venue. It carries a refined elite ambiance, but the service and food don't really match up with it.My party was there at 6 and got a table around 7:55/8:00. I didn't experience the wait room or the wait time as mentioned previously, because I was working out in Richmond, Texas at the time. The wait is long and they wouldn't allow a reservation to be made. The whole point of this stupid restaurant was to celebrate Texas Independence Day, albeit a few days late. The BF kept talking this place up as if it were the most magical, tasty, steak and meat loving place ever. Unfortunately, it was not. (Alright, the restaurant isn't stupid...just woefully ignorant of basic restaurant service.)I got in maybe five minutes after my party and had never been there before. The waiter didn't take the time to explain the salad bar to me (hey those plates are hidden and when you're hungry you don't want to read open compartment to find cold plates- you feel stupid!), the waiter also didn't offer me pepper for the salad, and rushed me for my drink order. You would have thought I arrived 30 minutes after the rest of the party. They had only ordered drinks and retrieved their salad. Later, I decide to share a meal with the BF's sister as I don't want to eat a huge steak by myself. I wanted it cooked a specific way as I'm not a fan of the rare, medium rare meats. Hey sorry, I need my cows cooked all the way. The food I received was under-cooked. I was visibly annoyed and upset. It's about 8:30/8:45 at this time and it's late. (I have to be at work early, so 9 pm is late for me unfortunately) I could either throw a big fuss, have to wait another 30 minutes to send my food back and have it cooked or I can go home and pay the check and tip the waiter. I chose to go home. One bite was enough. Other little annoyances: They took my silverware away without letting me save it, so I had to ask for another set and it took a while to get it. I had to remind the waiter,  ""Hey need silverware.' (Insert sad emo face at this point.) Any of the toast cream cheese/fruit spreads were taken away without giving me a chance to ask them to leave it. As if this wasn't enough, the guy took way to long to get me a to go box. I wanted out ASAP.So the meat was eh. The side dish- mash potatoes tasted flavorless, which was really disappointing. They only highlight was probably the salad bar and the bread/toast served at the table, which I wasn't even allowed to enjoy. Now, with all that, I could have said, okay, maybe it was a bad night. My BF and his  sister had a similar experience with under-cooked food after I left and even spoke to a hostess about it. She in turn gives them the manager number and while he's apologetic he keeps insisting they should have alerted him to their complaints earlier. Well...if the hostess knows there is a problem and gives you a number isn't that more of a management problem than a customer problem? Tell your hostess to get a manager if customers are complaining. It's that simple. The owner claims he'll make it right next time, but I don't think it's worth the time or effort. I much rather just go to a Salt Grass or Outback Steakhouse. I know steak lovers everywhere are groaning, but at least Salt Grass and Outback have trained waiters to look for visible cues that something is wrong and hostesses will use common sense in approaching a manager after a complaint if there's a policy to only fix things and issue complaints at the time of service. Maybe it's (Salt Grass/Outback) is not  a $60 steak, but they actually cook things the way you tell them too and the managers and waiters are only too happy to fix screw ups before, during, and after the dining experience. If I'm going to fork over $60+ in food, then well you need to be awesome. If I wanted mediocre service there's a place called Taco Bell and even they probably serve better steak tacos....Final thoughts: If you must try it for the experience and bragging rights, then go eat there, but you're not allowed to be cranky if you didn't heed my advice. Apparently the service has gone down since the last time my BF went, so I'm in no rush to go back to see if things improve. Maybe I'll be dragged back next Texas Independence Day, but I'm not looking forward to it after this dining experience. It does at least remind me that cooking my own food isn't a bad option and that simply being expensive doesn't mean you're tasty...it just means you're expensive. Lesson learned."
"First time visiting this weekend and it was great. Our server Robbie was a pleasant server, not over bearing and very respectful. We had the baked Brie appetizer. Delicious. I had the pecan crusted chicken and my husband had the prime rib. We had the key lime pie for dessert which is homemade. We love that this isn't a chain restaurant and right now the restaurant has Christmas decor and it's beautiful. Would love to bring my family when they're visiting for their  holidays"
"I Love  Taste of Texas. I had my Bday dinner here , the service was number one,  the manager Michael assured me the best steak in town. AMANDA got me the BEST service along with her beautiful smile and friendly welcome.  I SURE love to come back and recommend to all my friends.  Well done job. TATES OF TEXAS.  Sera"
"The staff and service is very professional. Steaks melt in your mouth and made to perfection. The salad bar is amazing with fresh vegetables, fruits, cheeses, and homemade breads. This is the best steakhouse in Texas!"
"SHAME ON THEM! The owners of this establishment have promoted hate mongering against the LGBT community. In front of the restaurant entrance they posted a ""Vote No on the Bathroom Bill"". A bill that ultimately was proposed to help workers from being discriminated based on race, gender, and sexual orientation. BEWARE! By supporting this business you are supporting fear and hate."
"Always excellent and the best quality.  We come here every week to celebrate birthdays!!!  The steaks are amazing and the salad bar is amazing.  Excellent service, attention to detail, and a fantastic privately owned place."
"Love this place.... a little pricey but worth it!  If you're a fan of steaks this place is for you!! They have a variety of options and a kids menu that will satisfy picky eaters.  They have 2 really good salad bars and a variety of baked breads. I had the bone in filet.... unfortunately it came out a little over cooked but they quickly replaced it with a perfect steak along with fresh sides.I highly recommend this place, but they're really popular and you have to come in early or else you can expect at least an hour wait..... regardless it will be well worth the wait!"
"My husband and I dined here on a Tuesday evening.  I ordered the NY strip medium well and it came out medium so I sent it back. The plate came back so sizzling hot I had to back my chair up the butter was splattering everywhere. The steak was well done but I didn't want to send it back again. It was ok but over cooked. We got mac n cheese and mashed potatoes as sides and they were very good. I wanted to take my leftovers (sides, meat, rolls) home and to my great disappointment when I opened my to go box there was only meat, fat, and rolls.  What happened to my sides?!? Overall service was good and attentive but disappointed in my steak and the leftovers pack up."
"Taste of Texas - If you looking to experience one of the best steaks on the planet this may be the place to find it. It's not surprising to most that Texans pride themselves in doing things on a grander scale than most and Taste of Texas is just one example that proves this theory. This ""Steak House"" has been serving up ""Certified Angus Beef"" since 1977 and if you don't understand the difference you will have to experience it, no description will do the steaks here justice.As you would expect Taste of Texas offers giant steaks amidst western decor, it should be no surprise to anyone that when a place serves up legendary steaks the atmosphere must equal the quality of the food, especially in Texas and this place will exceed your expectations if you truly appreciate this level of dining. If this is your first attempt at getting a table here and you want to avoid the frustration of a extended wait there are ways to accomplish this since they don't take reservations for parties less that four. It's pretty simple on weekdays arrive here no later than 6:00 PM our wait on this Wednesday evening was less than 10 minutes this restaurant is huge and its staffed to accommodate the masses within reason. As for the weekends good luck I've never experience it but from reading the other reviews and speaking with the locals it can be nearly impossible to avoid some type of wait but well worth it in my opinion.As you know quality always comes with a price you should expect to pay between $40 - $60 for a choice steak with that price comes a few perks, if you choose to participate you will be taken into the kitchen and allowed to pick your steak so if you prefer a leaner cut over a amazingly marbled cut its your choice, all the servers are trained to guide you to the perfect cut to suit your taste. Once you pick your steak it will be tagged with a metal badge numbered so you are sure to get the steak you picked cooked to the exact temperature of your liking. Your next stop after exiting the kitchen will be the dual salad bar, although the offerings are plentiful I must admit it's falls short of the infamous salad bars at the well known Brazilian Steak Houses but this place is about the steak and you really don't want or need to fill up on the salad here, you will want to enjoy the entree trust me on this one. Your steak comes with a single trip to the salad bar and one side, the sides are all premium but almost went unnoticed once the steaks were served. Tomahawk Ribeye (I had to try this on my first visit)Serious steak for a serious steak lover. Impressive 38 ounces with a 14"" bone hanging off the plate. You will never forget your first Tomahawk! Wow is not a very impressive description but this giant steak turns head when being delivered to the table. Don't let the 38 ounces scare you away the huge Fred Flintstone bone-in ribeye nets about 22 - 24 oz of succulent tender juicy steak I'm guessing.The steaks are aged between 35 - 42 days this fact along separates this place from everyone else. This was one of the best steaks I've every eaten just a suggestion please don't order this more than medium this was cooked medium rare and was absolutely heaven. Our neighboring table was just as impressed with this mammoth steak and commented on the14"" bone hanging off the plate and how much her dog would love it, so of course I donated it to the pup knowing she would enjoy the bone as much as I enjoyed this steak. ($57.95)Cowboy SteakThis 24 oz. ""bone-in"" ribeye steak brings you the famous rich flavor of ribeye enhanced with aging on the bone. This was also a beautify steak marbled perfectly and from the looks of it when my friend was finish equaled any he had eaten anywhere. (49.95)New York Strip SirloinThe steak lover's choice and the house specialty. The 16 oz. Certified Angus Beef boneless strip sirloin is the finest steak money can buy. I never considered this cut as being the best steak offered here but by the look of the empty plate apparently it lived up to its reputation  ($41.95)"
I've been going to Taste of Texas now for 30 years.  I've never had a bad experience.  For lunch I usually get the Soup and salad bar.  They have an excellent salad bar.  Quail bites are my favorite appetizer.  I purchased a set of their steak knives about 20 years ago and they are high quality and will certainly last another 20 years
"I've been to taste of Texas on several occasions over the last five years. I can honestly say the best thing it had going for it is the salad bar. I'm a huge fan of unlimited trips to a gourmet salad bar, but I also quite enjoy a serving of protein with my meal. At taste of Texas can order the salad bar and a grilled chicken breast. They just bring you the chicken on a plate and you add it to your salad or eat it alone. Perfect. Back to the salad bar offerings. They have all the standard makings of a good salad bar, but they also offer unlimited fresh bread. In Texas, that includes cornbread. And here it's filled with actual corn and jalapeños. If you go, make sure you eat at least one slice. But be warned, stopping at one is quite difficult."
Best steaks and buffet appetizer ever! They've got a nice alcohol menu too! If you haven't been yet this place is a must try!
"The place is very nice, salad bar is amazing with so much variety. The staff is very friendly but I do not think that they know what they are doing. I had the bone in felt and asked for medium well. It came rare, when talked to the manager he said as you get close to the bone it will be like this. That is not the answer I was looking for. I should have been told when asked for medium well that to expect to be rare al the way. You can see the redness and blood and taste cold flesh."
Mann Taste of Texas was amazing went here for the first time tonight and I got it say everything was amazing...I'm talking about like the place the food service and especially the food! Everything was awesome basically the salad bar is unlimited you can go as many times as you want they even have breads! But the best part was the food...me and my bro had the tomahawk steak and omg it was amazing! Another best part was that you get to pick out your own steak which ever piece you want I thought that was really cool and one of a kind! Def recommend it...and I promise once the tomahawk steak is brought to your table you are gonna attract a lot of attention around you!
2.5hrs wait. I don't care how good the food is. Life is way too short to wait 2.5for a steak I could get elsewhere that has reservations.
Get the jams and bread at the salad bar. The red jam tastes like Christmas. You'll know what I mean when you try it.I love this place. The decor the food everything. A little pricey but worth it. Soooo good
"Bday dinner planned by my wonderful sisters Janice and Thuy. Right when you walk through the doors....There is complimentary sodas, chips and salsa, popcorn, etc. Compensates for the 45- 1 hr wait. Typically the normal wait time for many popular places on the weekends. Party of 12 and we sat down in 40 mins. Service was amazing!!!! Loved our waitress Melissa! Mgr's were very accommodating and wonderful as well. Even the staff members just passing by us!We ordered two kids plate to split among four children. The best part of this,is the time the waiters/waitress took to cut the meat for the kids. Very sweet and such a warm hospitality feeling.I ordered the cowboy steak w Brussels sprouts w bacon Jam and Mac and cheese. No steak sauce was needed. Garlic butter was all the sauce needed to complete the flavor of the steak. 49.95 with one side and complimentary salad bar buffet style. The rest of my family got the ribeye w the marble cut side. $2.55/oz There seems to be a deal that was given if you ordered a large portion as family style but it seems to not exist anymore. In the end , our waitress Melissa took plenty of pictures  to last for a long time of memories. On top of it! They put it in a nice card to thank us for celebrating our special occasion w Taste of Texas. We had three kinds of dessert. The tremendously tall chocolate cake, snickers cheesecake, and keylime cake. All were very delish! My fave would be the snickers cheesecake. A memorable birthday I can't forget!"
Very good steaks. Nice beef and soft. Clean and friendly. Salad bar is very very delicious. Nothing to complain about this place.
"Hands down the best steakhouse Ive ever been too.  Amazing food.  Amazing staff.  Amazing experience every visit.  Make sure you arrive early as they DO NOT accept reservations.  We have been there for a 2hour wait...trust me, its worth it."
"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here yesterday. We got there just before opening and there was already a line. The manager greeted us and we asked about the wait and mentioned our anniversary. He said to mention it to the server. Our server was Valentina and she was very friendly and knowledgeable. I had the medallions and my husband had the porterhouse. Everything we had was excellent but the asparagus could've been cooked a bit longer . The salad bar was excellent as always . For our anniversary, we were allowed to pick one complimentary dessert to share and we chose the snickers cheesecake which did not disappoint. The cinnamon coffee was also complimentary and is a must try. They even took our picture and let us keep it as a souvenir . We will be back!"
I'm sad that I didn't really enjoy my steak here. I got the filet mignon and it was just okay. I got sautéed mushrooms on the side and those were so good but this place is known for their steaks and I left disappointed. I'm giving it 3 stars because the service was great and everyone was so nice. Very clean and professional. Though I feel like I've made a better filet mignon myself than the one I had here so I probably won't come back. I came here with my friend and he wasn't too impressed with his steak either.
"It had been awhile since our last visit. After all the superlative reviews, my son and I decided it was time to go back. Although the steak was good, it didn't quite live up to all the hype. (We both ordered center cut filets.) Maybe it was an off-night, maybe we should have ordered something different but the steaks were just ok. I kind of expected more given the price tag."
"This review is for lunch, although dinner is great as well! I have to say this is place has the very best salad bar in the city. The service is always impeccable and quality is always top notch. There are several options for lunch depending on how hungry you are. I prefer either just the salad bar or soup/salad combo. The fresh baked breads (included with salad bar) are so awesome. You can get in and out in about 45 min during lunch with no wait generally. The salad bar with water will cost around $12 but you definitely can feel the value. I highly recommend!!"
"This is a must try place if you live in Houston or just visiting. Their salad bar is amazing...nobody can match their salad bar. The main entrees are very good, fresh and quality food prepared by an experienced chef. This is a great place to take clients if you are looking to impress."
"Best Steakhouse EVER! Only downside is the long wait just to get a table as they don't do reservations. Food is amazing, from steak to salad bar and if its your birthday you get a free dessert and picture taken by staff. Great experience every time."
"If you're a steak lover like me then this is the place for you. Prepare to arrive super early because this place gets packed quick. Please note that this place does not take reservations. However, while waiting they have soda, chips/salsa, popcorn and sometimes appetizers for people waiting... all for free!while waiting, grab a menu and look over what you're going to order so when you get seated you can order asap. If you order an entree (Center cut medium rare is my preferred choice) the salad bar comes along with your meal & is probably the most FRESH salad that I've ever tasted in my life. Everything from the onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, different assortment of cheeses & breads that they have available (OMG!!! Just go try it because you won't regret it) The steak took about 20 mins to come out and when it did, it looked like a beast. I ordered a 23 oz steak and when it came out, it looked like a beast. I asked for medium rare and it came out just perfect. The lemon garlic butter was on point. The steak was juicy and tender.  the steak also came with 1 side. I decided on the potato au gratin. It was a very delicious choice.Complimentary desserts for special occasions!So make room for the Snickers cheescake & Creme Brulee"
"I've been here four times and every time it's been an amazing experience. The atmosphere is so warm, cozy, yet classy and sophisticated. I always order the filet, which is always super tender, juicy, and flavorful.I'm a huge fan of steak sauce, but I never allow myself to use it with filet from here because it's just so flavorful already. I always add the garlic butter on top which I highly recommend doing because it adds great flavor. This is the only steakhouse I've been to that actually cooks the steak exactly medium-well. Every time my steak is cooked perfectly, and never fatty at all.I always get the sweet potato fries on the side which are always tasty. I'm not a salad lover AT ALL, but I always get excited for the salad bar here. They have amazing salad choices, every salad dressing you can think of, and so many amazing toppings! And everything is super fresh and clean.I love how they have different types of breads, and different butters! The cinnamon butter is my favorite. The corn bread is amazing too! The service here is always top notch. Everyone is so professional, friendly, and welcoming. The desserts are to die for too. The creme brûlée is delicious, the strawberry cheesecake is amazing, and their snickers cake is really good. Over all this is my favorite steakhouse."
My server Greg was extremely attentive to all my steak needs It's really difficult to make a steak rare medium and their chef nailed it. Bravo...they let me in the back look over the cuts... Also had to take a call and waiter was super patient. The chef pesonally came to my table and I cut into the end of the 32 oz porterhouse...I initially thought it was medium and told this to the chef. He showed me that actually they managed through most of the steak to make it a true rare medium!
"I echo the other reviews that feel that while Taste of Texas used to be a go-to place for a nice evening out for steaks, it isn't any more. My husband and I went Saturday evening for our anniversary dinner; we hadn't been here in quite a while, and were a bit shocked at the overall decline in atmosphere. The good:We were seated in about an hour and 15 minutes, which was within the stated wait time when we arrived. We ordered a spinach artichoke dip to start, which was very good. We both went to the salad bar, which was enjoyable as always. I ordered the 10 oz. filet with garlic butter with a loaded potato, and my husband ordered a 16 oz. ribeye with a loaded potato. My filet was very good, cooked as requested, and very flavorful. Our waiter brought us a complimentary Snickers cheesecake for dessert for our anniversary, which is delicious (am eating the leftovers as I type this). Finally, our server, Kevin, was lovely. He took great care of us without being overbearing, and we enjoyed his personality and sense of humor. If the restaurant watches these reviews, please know Kevin does a great job. The bad:My husband ordered his ribeye medium rare, and it came out medium. Even more surprising, it was chewy and a little tough. For roughly $50 a steak, you do not expect a tough or chewy ribeye. The really bad: The atmosphere (or the complete lack thereof). As we walked up to the front doors, standing literally in front of the permanently posted ""Proper attire required"" sign was a group of people waiting for a table, all wearing t-shirts, shorts, and flip flops. During our visit, we saw people in baseball hats, white undershirts, gym shorts, sports jerseys, cut-off shorts with butt cheeks hanging out...you name it, it was there - except for appropriately dressed patrons. I don't quite know how to describe what the scene looked liked; if the $50/plate prices hadn't told me otherwise, I could have been sitting at an Applebee's on a Saturday night, not Taste of Texas. I completely agree with another reviewer that while this used to be a nice place for a date or special evening, for the money I'll go somewhere else that provides some ambience along with the higher price tag. Such a shame to see the restaurant has permitted this to become the new standard."
"Everything was amazing, I had the Quail skewers as an appetiser,  and got a lovely looking piece of sirloin that I had chosen from their butchery in the kitchen. However, I had discovered that it wasn't the steak I had chosen because the numbers didn't match on the tag, so my waiter Quinton expressed how sorry they were and offered for me to chose a new steak. They made it up beautifully and quickly. The manager then personally apologised and insisted that desert was on him. We got the apple dumplings which were amazing and beautiful presented. Though I may not be in Texas for a while, I'll never forget the great food and service at Taste of Texas."
"LOOOONG WAIT!!!My friend and I visited at 8pm on a Tuesday and there was 90 minute wait. However, the waiting area provides free popcorn, chips/salsa, and soda, which made it bearable. All the other reviews here state how awesome the food is, so I don't feel like I need to go into it more. Rest assured your food will come out perfectly. I just wanted to comment on the service provided here:This is a place where the servers eye your table like a hawk. A carafe of iced tea was on the table, and the server would constantly come by and fill my cup with tea, even if it was 80% full! When my friend went to the bathroom, the server came by and folded his napkin for him. I'm not accustomed to restaurants with this level of service, so I was definitely pleasantly surprised."
We took our out-of-state guests here and it was perfection! They had prime rib and our friends said it was the best they've ever had. Customer service is also exceptional. Their salad bar is also the best in the Houston area with tons of options and even warm breads and blocks of cheese. Yummmm! The ambiance is warm and neighborly with interesting Texas artifacts. We will definitely will be back! Thank you Taste of Texas for a great experience!
"Prime rib is amazing here. The rib eye also. They don't take reservations but the wait, if there happens to be one, is worth it! They let you select your piece of meat if you wish to and the salad bar is pretty darn great. this has to be my favorite steak house in Houston."
"Ok. I'm not a complainer, but I've had a LOT of fine steaks in my time, from various restaurants across america.  This place came HIGHLY recommended to me by colleagues, clients and my parents. For the price, I was given a pretty awful, quite tough and almost inedible rib-eye steak, that soon after eating (while I was still at the restaurant) made me ill with a bad stomach ache.  I was SO  hungry that I ate it despite my intuition to send it back.  As I was eating it, my wife said her steak was too tough to eat, as well.  She noticed there was globules of tough, flavorless fat and gristle.  Not the good, properly cooked fat of a properly cooked and high quality rib-eye that we're used to.  This thing was  shoe leather tough.  Her teeth and jaw were hurting from trying to chew on this steak, so that should give you an indication of how it was.  She had enough and she complained.  After that steak, they brought her another one which was equality horrible, but additionally undercooked this time.  She sent it back AGAIN, then finally they gave her a half-decent steak (She was pretty starved at this point, so it was kind of like a ""This is still totally not worth it, but I'm starving so I don't care anymore"" feeling is what she described).  Honestly, it just wasn't   as good as another steak in that price range.  Very disappointed...Sad really,  because it came so highly recommended.  My wife advised me to stop eating and ask for another steak or a different cut.  In the end, I was too hungry and  now regret not having asked for my meal to be taken off the bill.  They tried to manage the situation and I was trying to be nice and so asked for a free dessert, but the fact is that the meat was so rough and tasteless, that it just felt overpriced.  Seriously, Saltgrass' Pat's Rib-eye is phenomenal next to the steak that my wife and I were served.  At a joint like this, We should've never had this kind of problem.  It's just unacceptable.  I spent the same amount (if the deserts weren't comp'd, it would have been more) as I would have at Chama Gaucho or Fogo de Chao, but got terrible value in return.  Salad bar was meh (my in-laws, who were dining with us, compared it to Sizzler's salad bar, which is where they eat at least once a week.  Sides were OK.  The best part was the artichoke dip and the asparagus.  Those were good.  The potatoes au gratin were OK.  My Mother-in-law wasn't crazy about the baked potato...I'm very disappointed and displeased overall. They should've offered to comp our meals, at least.  I should've spoken up, too.  But honestly, this type of thing shouldn't have happened to begin with.  I came here for quality and good service, I left with none of the first and some of the latter.  In conclusion: 1 star for having good appetizer and for decent service.1 star because my in-laws were happy with their steaks for the most part (Well-done rib-eyes).Recommendation: Go to Fogo, Chama Gaucho, Texas de Brazil or Salt Grass for rib-eye.For a truly top notch steak: Go to Pappas Bros Steakhouse or The Capital Grille.Cheers!"
"Something for everyone!What a great concept! In business over 35yrs... we now know why!Great family environment! Great for parties or groups... Great food & great options for vegetarians as well!Warm interior, decorated w lots of wood... homey feel. Very friendly staff!Rafael, our server, was well versed in all the offerings and very kind. Make it your business to visit a Taste of Texas - you will not be disappointed! your constant companion,~deirdra"
"Always a treat. I love the steaks, the atmosphere and salad bar. The staff are very professional and very attentive. I've been here at least 20 times and have never been disappointed. The owners and management have hit the nail on the head every time since they opened. Great job"
"I've been there so many times in all occasions and had all kinds of steak (tomahawk, cowboy, bone in etc)  but sill craving for their steak every once a while. Waiting time is expected but worth it"
Awesome service or my 31st anniversary. See you next year! Service was excellent. Food was perfectly prepared.
"Prepare to wait a looooong time, unless you get here at 3pm on a Sunday (right when it opens) like I did & get seated right away :) It got packed extremely quick. Salad bar (5/5) all you can eat if you order steak! Idk what it is about the salad here, but best salad I've ever had, hands down! Center cut steak (4.5/5) I wouldn't say it's the best ever, but it's pretty up there! Medium rare, cooked to perfection. So juicy... *drool Complimentary desserts for special occasions!Great food, GREAT service!! I devoured my steak so fast that the manager actually came up to me, apologized for having to ""wait so long"" for my food to come out (my family was still eating), and asked what I had ordered so he could end my wait. HAHA now that's great service!! Maybe I should actually chew my food... it's so hard to be patient with the steak!I'd say you're missing out if you've never been."
"It's been awhile since we been here, so we decided to have dinner here last night . Waited almost 2 hours to get a table, but the food last night was a disappointment. The bf ordered New York and I ordered a ribeye and a crab cake. His steak tasted like it's been defrosted a couple times, and mine was overcooked. We were too hungry to wait another 30 minutes for our steaks. Their standard seemed to have drop from the last time we went. I'm not sure if it's because they were super busy last night or something changed in the kitchen, but I'm sure they should be used to handle a big volume of people by now."
"Wow! Worth the hype. The salad bar is wonderful and I had the prime rib, cooked perfectly medium rare and absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. Portobello mushroom cap side was huge and again cooked perfectly. This is the perfect spot to take out of state guests to show some of the best steak that Houston has to offer."
"I love their veggie plate. The fried avocado was great. Bread was served warm. There were crowded . The salad bar I love it, they added the quinoa there so you can add it to your salad. Overall I loved the food!"
"So its my grand parents 60th anniversary and we wanted to do something special. Fortunate for us it was also Valentines Day so they are super busy. We call ahead and the excellent staff allow us to bring in decorations flowers, all that jazz. Long story short, while we were setting up, one of the helium balloons escaped and we thought we were doomed. Lucky for us our server came in and saved the day, with long lamp stick. We were forever grateful. It was one of those things when we thought all hope was lost, then out of nowhere the golden opportunity strikes! Aaron Rogers Hail MARY!Anyways our server was amazing, and although I forget his name, (maybe ill update it later) I will always remember his kind deed! 10/10 will come back to this place.O also food is yummy."
"I would say these are the best steaks in Houston. I've tried Perry's, Flemmings, Morton's and all the other high end steakhouses and I prefer Taste of Texas. The service is awesome the managers stop by and make sure everything is exactly to your liking and staff is also top notch. They'll even let you pick your steak if you like. I can't say enough good things about the service.I have eaten here for years and they are very consistent; if you order medium rare it will ALWAYS be medium rare. The steaks are great. You can't go wrong with any choice: My favorite is the T-bone or the NY strip, but I've seen a lot of folks order the filet. If you awant a giant steak order the porterhouse or the tomahawk ribeye. Definitely augment your steak with the lemon pepper and garlic butter. My favorite side is the Texas Au Grautin potatoesThey have a great salad bar everything is fresh including bread and house made dressings. They have a delicious cinnamon butter that goes well with the yeast rolls.If you love steak and great service make sure to try Taste of Texas.Come early! They don't take reservations and it gets packed fast and you quickly run into a 1+hour wait."
Salad bar still amazing! They added a kale salad and quinoa to their salad bar. Both were lightly seasoned and tasted great with the salad dressing I used (cilantro vinaigrette). Service was amazing as always.
Excellent service! Awesome steaks and fun atmosphere.  Brought my family here based on recommendations and wow what a great time.  The food was fresh and prepared as promised.  Can be busy as we waited 40 minutes but well worth the wait!
"The service here tonight was outstanding.  Friendly and fast.  Drinks were refilled, and dishes were cleared away quickly.  Very attentive.  Truely 5 star service.My center cut filet ranked in my top 3.  Very tender and cooked perfectly.  Flavorful due to the aging.  You can get garlic butter on top, or bacon wrapped (or both) at no additional charge.  Just do it.My side was broccoli with hollendaise sauce.  This is a perfect combination, the buttery lemon flavored sauce is delicious and the broccoli was cooked just right.  The best side dish of the night was the grilled portabella mushroom.  I would get this next time.The thing that always pushes me past my limit is the salad bar.  So fresh with so many choices.  It is impossible to walk away with a small salad.  By the time I put a small spoonful of this and that, I walk away with a plate piled high.  The Texas Caviar (black eyed peas) is so good, as is the  black bean and corn salad,.  The jalapeno cornbread is amazing.  Hard to stop eating it.I love that you can dine here in casual clothes.The wait on Friday or Saturday night can exceed an hour and a half.  Get here early, or late.  They do not take reservations."
"To be honest, I don't even know why I'm reviewing this place. Taste of Texas is an institution and one of the best steak houses in town and you don't need to read more than one or two reviews to figure that out. It's our go-to for all our important celebrations. The service is amazing and the food is always prepared to perfection. The only complaint I could ever have is that they don't take reservations. I figure they must have their reasons though. Just take my advice and go. Try to save room for desert because they're incredible, but if you don't I won't blame you. Just get it to go ;)"
Valentina was great!! The service exceptional!!!love their salad bar and potato soup!!!
"Taste of Texas is one of the two or three restaurants in Houston that I will miss the most, now that I've moved away.  The steaks there were always done to perfection, and the food really was not that pricy given the quality.  The restaurant's no reservations policy makes eating there a little inconvenient, at least if you don't want to eat dinner at 3 p.m.  But if you do go at 3 p.m., there are plenty of open seats.Food-wise, the only thing I found disappointing at Taste of Texas was the bread.  I just was not a fan of their rolls.  My wife liked them a lot, though.The salad bar is great."
"We eat here a few times a year; generally when someone visits from out of town and they ask for great steak.From the service to the meals, everything is top notch. Be warned, parking may be a challenge based on the night of the week. We have had waits of up to 30 minutes, and we have just used that time to grab a drink and catch up.Tip: do not fill up on the salad or bread because you will do yourself a disservice by not having room for dessert.I would pass on the prime rib because they have so many other cuts of steak that are out of this world. Have a big boy eater visiting? The tomahawk will present a worthy challenge. Picky eater, the center cut filet. Add the oscar, lump crab meat, its worth it. Veggies, have the brussel sprouts with bacon jam. I do not like vegetables and have ordered this twice. Yes, it is a p Ivey visit, but worth the cost.Regarding attire, we have seen people in suits, blue jeans and shorts. In fact, I have visited the restaurant in each of the above."
"Salad bar here is good and bread is plus Order to go last Sunday when I got there everything was ready my appetizer and my soup, baked potatoes etc.. Except my filet mignon  first they bought out to bar where I was waiting and they took it back bought it out in to go box so I went home star eating my filet is so cold, dry, hard it was not even worth what I paid for I'm mad!! And I live in memorial which is right down of street from restaurant my steak shouldn't be that cold  anyway I call back spoke to manager what happen he put me on hold for good almost 10min and phone got hung up some reason and I call back! Manager answer still no apologize whatsoever took my name number, and he will talk to owner and get back to me! Haven't heard from them! I'm pretty sure they can care less, but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any of my friend family co worker or anybody that I know"
"This is one of my favorite steakhouses in Houston.the beef cuts are fantastic and you can go to the butcher shop and pick your cut of choice.  I normally go with the filet mignon or the bone-in filet mignon (if very hungry).  Make sure to ask for a bacon wrapped filet and some garlic butter on top.  Also, the salad bar is outstanding, all kind of fresh items to create your very own signature salad.  You also have the option to pick some freshly baked dinner rolls, cheese bread and jalapeño corn bread.  The wait staff is very friendly.  You may end up waiting for a table, but it will be totally worth it."
"We ate here on a Tuesday night and the place does very well for an early weeknight. Upon entering we were unable to find our party but we had several management staff trying to help us locate them. It turns out they were in the secret waiting room ,which is quite awesome; it has a popcorn machine, chips and salsa, and a soda machine in which you can help yourself. This definitely occupied and satisfied the 8 year old and the toddler in our group.As for dinner, I had a 6 oz fillet, a side of shrimp, a side of potatoes au gratin and a side of spinach. They invited everyone back to pick their cut, to which I was surprised, but I sent my husband while I watched our toddler. The filet was good, but the shrimp didn't taste fresh at all. I couldn't even eat it. The potatoes were fantastic and the spinach was decent.Our server was alright, I could tell he was busy, but he'd disappear for a little too long. Perhaps I notice these things more with an active toddler. I like to get in and out, however our party wasn't necessarily in any rush and that's fine.The salad bar was fine, but I certainly don't think it compares to that of Fogo de Chao, or anything like that. There were options, but not as many options, such as artichoke hearts or hearts of palm, which are things I really love to see at a salad bar."
This place is really what everyone raves about! So delicious.I got spinach artichoke dip- SO GOOD.We got the special steak wrapped in bacon with the special sauce (can't remember the name) I couldn't even believe how phenomenal it was!! So good I want to go back and get it again! :)Service was great & friendly. The environment was not too loud and comfortable. Definitely a must go to. Make your hubby or boyfriend take you here for a special occasion!
"Get there early!  We got there at 3:00 when they opened and were immediately seated. Our waiter Kevin was very professional and explained everything. He even took us on the mini tour of the back where you select your steak. My 9 year old daughter thought it was the coolest thing!  The salad bar is awesome, but don't go overboard  because you still have to eat your steak!  Ordered the Tomahawk with garlic mashed potatoes and was not disappointed. My Wife had the filet and she liked hers as well. We will definitely be back."
"My old time classmate took my family to get a taste of real Texas steaks. I had a tomahawk and my wife had a salmon, it's so nice and juicy and the flavor is one of a kind for both a steak and the salmon, I have to share the steak with my son because it's so huge. The homemade bread tasted so wonderful and the service is too notched. We waited for 2.5 hours but it's worth the wait!"
"I just love this place, the service and the food are fantastic. From the salad bar to the desert and everything in-between the experience is just 1st class"
"I give this place 3 stars because the quality of meat is great and and our waiter was good but at the end of the day, I wouldn't come back. As soon as you walk in, you get this cabin feel which i love and As every one else says, expect to wait at least 30mins depending upon your time of arrival. We got there around 7:45 so our expected wait was 45mins-1hour.. But as you read, there is complimentary popcorn, beverages, and chips&salsa along with 2 bars. After almost an hour, a Hostess sat us down where we were greeted by our waiter, he was very nice, knowledgable, and attentive! Salad bar was yummy as well cus they give u plenty of options to add to your salad. We ordered the mushroom caps stuffed with crab to start off with which came right after we finished our salads. You get 6 for about $14.. It was ok, I thought they were average.. It wasn't suuuper delicious but it wasn't bad... I ordered the Oscar filet (about $40ish) 6 oz which was super tasty and soft since i eat it rare and my boyfriend got the ribeye 16oz (I think it was 2.95/oz and minimum of 16oz) which he finished! Make sure you get the garlic butter on top of your steak if you're a garlic lover like me! I got the green beans with bacon as my side, it was ok (super delicious tho if u add the garlic butter into it) but the Mac and cheese is BOMB! Overall this restaurant was great for its quality of meat but I can enjoy a cheaper steak at home. The staff and our waiter was nice and the food came out quit fast. Since it was so busy and there was quit a few large parties, it wasn't very romantic and loud. Waiters can be heard talking/shouting to one another across the room. Def an experience but I wouldn't crave it to come back."
May the odds be in your favor!!! That's how I decided the parking! !! Omg it's like the hunger games!! It took us 30 minutes to park on top of the 45 minute wait!! The service is outstanding! The waiter was extremely welcoming and knowledgeable. The steaks in my opinion are just a bit more then average. Not seasoned at all if it had not been for the blue cheese butter my steak would have been hard to finish. I suggest you also pass on the win a little over priced about  $25 per bottle over retail for grocery store wines like Kendall kendall-jackson....
"Went there with my girlfriend for a early valentines day dinner and wow am i a satisfied customer. Server Jon O. made this experience even better and was very knowledgeable about everything we needed to know about the menu. I got the tomahawk steak med rare 38 Oz of juicy well aged goodness. It really was the best steak I've ever had and on top of it all they let you pick out the steak you want, and even make suggestions of how much marble or not you should have or not depending on your taste. If you have a special occasion and are a steak lover do your and your loved ones a favor and make a trip down. It is pretty pricy but well worth it. Just be ready to wait and be seated I'm sure it varies depending on times of day/week."
"Right when you walk in through the doors, the mesmerizing decor and ambience hit you. This place is like a museum! Everywhere you look there's amazing information and decor all related to Texas. Service was great. Getting the chance to pick my own steak and having a salad bar was pretty cool. Everything was perfect til I tasted the steaks. For a place that's so popular and expensive I expected so much more than the mediocre filet & tomahawk steaks that my boyfriend and I got. It's honestly not worth the price. I was incredibly disappointed"
"Excuse me as I drag myself out of this food coma and see what I can remember from last night...Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- possibly one of the best I've ever tasted. It was served w/ a horseradish dip and perfect for splitting between 2.Texas Pecan Crusted Chicken- stuffed w/ a spinach & artichoke blend and came with sides of green beans & rice pilaf. We shared this entree and they split it up for us on separate plates. Normally this would warrant an additional charge at other restaurants (big pet peeve!) but not here. The rice had a weird rubbery taste so I left it mostly untouched. This turned out to be a good thing since I did not need any more carbs after a trip to their bread station. The chicken was good, but I would probably order a steak next time since steaks are their specialty. Salad Bar- this turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. They had a great fresh selection of greens, veggies, pasta salads, dressings, and fresh fruit. Next to that was the bread station with jalapeno cornbread, buttery rolls, and cheese bread. Spreads included butter, jams, and the best honey cinnamon butter that tasted exactly like a churro! As a meal itself, it only cost $9.95 which is definitely a steal.Atmosphere- It's hard to imagine a place being fancy and casual at the same time, but this place is it. It's not somewhere you need to get all dressed up for (jeans & a nice top/casual dress will do). As for the decorations, I don't know how else to describe them other than ""Texas."" Service- cups were always filled, menu items were explained, suggestions were made, dishes were delivered smoothly, and the waiters were a good amount of talkative. I will be back for a next time once I have a bigger wallet & more self-control to face the bread station!"
"Number one rule: GET THERE EARLY! If you are going for dinner, I would suggest getting there around 5:45pm on a weekday and around 5pm on a weekend if you want to have dinner at a reasonable time. Any time after that, and the wait will be between 1-2 hours. (so bring something to entertain yourself with if you end up going late) Food: The food is delicious, as expected. The salad bar has a great variety and yummy breads to try, including your traditional rolls, cheesy bread, and jalapeno cornbread. You get to pick your own cut of meat in their kitchen which is also a great experience, and their servers are very well informed about their meats. The one thing I would warn you about is that they may slightly overcook your steak, so if you normally get your steak medium well, I would suggest telling them medium, or if you like it medium, ask for medium rare.        Sides: I would suggest getting the Mac and Cheese, Au Gratin, or sweet potatoes. *side note* If you get the ribeye, you can choose what size you want it, anywhere from 16oz to your heart's desire. We had a friend who got a 64oz steak (but sadly didn't finish it in one sitting =(.  ) Service: The service is great and the servers are definitely friendly and attentive. They're all very cordial and welcoming and really easy to talk to and actually seem to care how you are enjoying your experience. The manager also goes around from table to table to talk to you and make sure everything is ok. Your food comes out all at once (which is always nice so you don't have to wait on each other), and is also cooked in a reasonable time.They have a waiting area for you as well, and you can order wine and cocktails, and snack on their complimentary nachos, popcorn, and soft drinks. Price: This is definitely on the pricier side of things, so if you want to impress, this is a great place to bring someone. On average, the cost for one person is around $40. Also, if you go in a group, I would suggest bringing cash because they will only do 4 split checks maximum. Overall, definitely a great experience, especially if you have visitors from out of town. Take a look at the pictures so you get an idea of the types of meats they have, and get there early, lest you want to walk far and wait for hours."
"A Texas style (as the name suggests) steak house that is great for large parties but isn't the romantic setting you'd want for an intimate date. So if you're in town for business or hanging out with your friends and want to grab some great steak, this is your place. It is a large restaurant with lots of sports decor. It's great for large groups. Unlike most high end restaurants they offer a buffet style salad bar. It's hardy so you may not need appetizers. Try the cornbread!Now, to the most important part of a steak joint... The meat. All of the cuts you'd expect are here. And you can select your own cut of meat if you want to. There are several seasoning options, including butter and garlic. I got both with a bacon wrap - I don't think you can clog your arteries faster if you try. But man was it good!!!'"
"First don't let the sign that you can barely see from the freeway fool ya! Yes, they need the letter lit better so it's viewable but every single other part of this place from the good to the service and on down to the ambiance is on point!Took the wife here for our 3 yr and had a great time. It is pricey but hey, you get what you pay for!As a fella RR owner myself great service and good food is priceless. 5 stars!And the fact they play subtle Christian music makes it even more of a home run!"
"At some point in life, men must eat steak. A Man's Steak. Thick, juicy, and hand-cut. The ribeye at Taste of Texas is such a beast. Order by the ounce, 16 oz minumum, I had 24 oz. I suppose I could have ordered more, but it was lunch, and I'd already eaten an appetizer of Quail Bites: Jalapeno stuffed Quail wrapped in bacon. Delicious, but then isn't anything wrapped in bacon? Service was superb."
Meat is very good however without the garlic butter they put on top they really don't have much seasoning to them. They were cooked to perfection. The mac n cheese is amazing. Salad bar is great and the toast with cream cheese/salsa they bring out is addicting. Pretty cool that while you wait they offer free soft drinks/tea and popcorn/chips & salsa.
"What an excellent dining experience!I came here for my birthday with my parents on a Saturday night. I must say we were caught a bit off guard by the wait time (We arrived at 6:00pm, and were told there was an hour to an hour and half wait), however we decided that would be pretty standard anywhere we went, so instead of getting mad and walking out, we decided to wait outside and enjoy the nice fall weather. It went by quickly, and free delicious appetizer samples were brought outside to all those waiting. We were seated by 7:05, which isn't bad at all for Houston on a Saturday night. Our server was Kevin, and he was excellent. Funny, prompt, and attentive. I ordered the 6oz. filet, with a side of 4 jumbo grilled shrimp and mac and cheese. The filet was so beautifully cooked I was sad to finish it. It was cooked to a perfect medium and so tender. The garlic butter on top was a decadent touch. The shrimp was actually jumbo and they were worth the $9.95 they cost. The mac and cheese was a revelation. It was baked, with breadcrumbs on top, and as for the flavor, it had a slight kick to it with some kind of pepper baked in. Absolutely delicious.Dessert was a gem. I had the snickers cake, my mom had the key lime pie, and my dad had the cinnamon ice cream (a Blue Bell specialty only sold at Taste of Texas). My cake was superb, as well as the key lime pie, but be advised that it's VERY sweet compared to other key lime pies, but it was still delicious nonetheless.This was a perfect meal to celebrate my birthday and I will absolutely be back."
"I came here for a coworker reunion, and I was definitely looking forward to it as other coworkers raved about the steaks and the salad bar.Unfortunately, I was not too hungry by the time I got here.  Of the French dip sliders I ordered, I only ate 1.5 of 3!  Alas...Steaks definitely seem to be the way to go  The dinner prices for steaks begin at $35 and go up to around $60.  Once you put in your order, they will take you to the butcher shop so you can pick out your own meat.  (Notably, all cuts are Certified Angus Beef.)The steaks come with choices of three sauces / rubs, and you can pick any combination of these three:1.  Lemon pepper2.  Garlic herb butter3.  Bleu cheeseIt also comes with a choice of one side and an all-you-can-eat salad bar.Most importantly, we had some Kazakhs with us.  The server was able to provide a menu in Russian.  She also brought out cowboy hats and red kerchiefs to take a picture of them having fun at Taste of Texas.  She then brought out cards with a 4x6"" of the picture (of them in their hats and kerchiefs) for each of them.  I thought that was a really nice touch and makes Taste of Texas a fun place to take your international guests."
Excellent steak. Helpful staff. Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly. Only thing I did not enjoy was paying $60 for an $18 bottle of wine.
"Taste of Texas is a really hard place for me to review. The food is fabulous - definitely really, really delicious steaks and desserts. But the ambiance is so confusing to me. If you're waiting for a table, you can go to the bar and enjoy some free chips and salsa, or popcorn, or sodas. I'm assuming this is to keep the kiddos from screaming because they're hungry. But if you're in the bar, be ready to listen to some Christian music. I'm not religious and it made me really uncomfortable to have to listen to it. I would have preferred some instrumental soft music rather than the soft-rock Christian. The mushroom caps are yummy. They're stuffed with crab meat, and topped with brie. They were rich and I really loved every bite that I had. I thought the crackers served with them were a bit odd and didn't contribute to the meal.I got a 6 oz center cut steak with a side of spinach. My steak was cooked perfectly and was tender - almost melt in your mouth. When you're in the main dining hall, you won't hear the music over the chatter from other groups of people, plus if you add a few drinks you're going to have a grand time. We got the pecan pie for dessert, and it was pretty good. I wasn't particularly a fan of the consistency of the center of the pecan pie (y'know, the super unhealthy corn syrup part) because it kind of broke down in a weird way. But mixed with the cinnamon ice cream... Whatever. Yummy. If you're a first timer, or visiting for a special occasion, you can be sure that you'll get the bandanna and cowboy hat to take a picture with. Would I go back? Probably not. If one of my friends insisted that we eat there, I'd say okay, but it's not a place that I'll quickly recommend to others."
Asked for a steak to be med well ( that cost 50) that came out burned :( hope not everyone get this when they go here
"I've been maybe 6 or 7 times and I honestly don't understand what all the hoopla is about. I much prefer the salad bar over any of their steaks. The meat is tender, I'll give them that, but it is flavorless. It tastes as if it was never seasoned."
Really great steak spot with a killer salad bar!  The steaks were prepared perfectly and the servers are very attentive.  I got a NY Strip and it was juicy and flavorful!The dessert tray is amazing but the 4 layer chocolate cake is so entirely crazy huge that you owe yourself a taste since it will last a long time!
"Best place I've ever eaten at. Service was flawless, you get to pick out your own cut of meat in the kitchen, salad bar was perfect, dessert was amazing, and did I mention the incredible service? Our waitress was a true master of her craft.   I ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye which was 36 ounces with a comically larger bone (14"") protruding from the side. It was cooked EXACTLY how it should be and was hilarious to see brought out to the table.   There is too much other stuff to mention here but it's all good."
"Great place to bring visitors to.  During Christmas a lot of their Texas decorations are removed which sucks.  The steaks here are so good and the service here is top notch.  We were given complimentary champagne when I got married.  Also, the wait is a bit long but you get free nachos, popcorn, and sodas."
"Pros:Steaks taste great.Service is always professional and on point.Menu is varied.Décor is true Texas.Salad bar is great.Waiting room is nice, complete with cash bar and free snacks and sodas.  Nice touch.Cons:The wait!  The wait is often over and hour and I wish they had some sort of reservation system.  I'll come here when I have time, but when I don't have time, I must go elsewhere for dinner.The wine list seems a little on the short side for a steak house.Parking is sometimes crazy.  There is no valet. All said, the steaks are good here and that's what keeps me coming back."
"The wife and I went here Feb 14th, and knowing how busy this restaurant is any night but on Valentines it can get nuts.  So we cheated and went at two pm, no line no wait!  The steaks were great, wonderful salad bar, the wait staff was perfect."
"OH MY GOODNESS! What a great restaurant. The food was outstanding, there was great service, extensive wine list, and a comfortably elegant atmosphere. Expect to be treated well by the friendly waitstaff, they are sure to go above and beyond. You can order a delicious steak, chicken or a some delicious seafood cooked just how you like it. The side dishes are just as pleasing!! The main entrees come with the salad bar and it is definitely worth it. It was very clean, well stocked and it's definitely no Ruby Tuesday salad bar!! I'll definitely be back."
"Homestead and Peter Luger Steakhouse has nothing on this place!Why I Love Taste of Texas:1. Ambiance is beautiful 2. They have a nicely sized waiting area with a bar and complimentary snacks3. Awesome salad bar is included with the steak dinner4. Option to choose your own steak! (First time for me)5. Everything from the steak to the sides were all so delicious!6. Decently priced7. Lastly, the staff is very friendly =)I've been to places where you have to pay $200 just for a damn steak but here we had a wonderful steak dinner for about $100, this place is definitely worth going to!"
"The salad bar is pretty awesome with great choice. We waited about 30 minutes before being seated, which is the norm here because it's just so busy.  The Carmel martini was great. The only down sides was the slight mix up on side order but more importantly my steak was rare not medium.A really nice touch was that the owner, who without question is a millionaire, went around to each table to introduce herself and see how we were doing."
"I have to echo the sentiments of other reviewers as to the service - it was top notch!!  The food was fantastic.  We were having a corporate party so we all got put into the Wine Room which was great for a group our size (probably about 40 - 45 people).  The staff were gracious and were diligent with their follow up.  The food came out at appropriate intervals so that it was hot and fresh when it arrived.  The beer selection is weak, but the wine was wonderful.  All in all, it was a very good experience and it felt like the food was priced appropriately for the portions and quality."
"Wow what a night. We arrived at 6:04pm someone jump out of the car to get on the list due to line being long out of the door. After circling parking lot twice for parking we parked in the Bed, Bath, and Beyond lot next door. This was our first time here my boyfriend and I. We had date night with 2 other couples. The plan eat and go to Dave and Busters to hang out. Tap our inner kids as we are all over 40. Anyway, we go in, there are people every where waiting MUCH more than outside. There is a nice waiting area with chips, popcorn, and TV's. Our waiting card had 6:04p card #174. After getting settled and found the monitor with the numbers on it we knew this was going to be a dinner only night. The monitor has #91, 102, and l06 on it. Oh boy, the saving grace I needed something from BB and B next door.  So we women had to go find it and leave the men folk waiting. OK let's get to the food I will just say. It was alright .  It is now 8:45pm we are called _____party of 6 your take is ready repeat from a young lady. Two count two seconds later last call for ____party of 6 by a rough sounding man. WTH? For two and a half hours I didn't hear a male voice at all. No appetizers due to drinks and chips we had while waiting. We ordered the T-Bone steak med well ($47.95) with a lobster tail ($19.95) baked potato loaded and a Wedge salad.  The steak was covered with garlic herb butter and was med rare. For the cost of the food I was not impressed with experience or the food. It was just OK. I have had steak spoon cutting tender before but this steak required a good knife. Not much flavor and far from the best steak I ever had. The lobster tail was an oversized shrimp. This was the smallest tail for $20. At least add the ounce size to the menu to prevent the look of disappointment when it gets to the table. For nonalcohol drinkers beware there are no flavored tea made here just some bottled stuff that was horrible. Taste of Texas should be on point when it comes to tea this is a Texas staple. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place. OK time update it is 10:04p as we get into the car wondering what happened and not feeling satisfied. I hate those kind of dining experiences as I am a self proclaimed foodie. I want to end on a high note. The staff was very nice."
"We LOVE this place!! Excellent service, prices, and food quality. The salad bar is amazing! This is our go to place for a quick and healthy lunch or a nice steak dinner. I usually just get the salad bar at dinner and add a soup for a few dollars and it fills me up quite well. The bread at the salad bar is great as well."
Dined here last night for my daughter's graduation. We were treated like royalty! Food and service was  exceptional! It was worth every penny!
"Had a wonderful experience here for my birthday. Our waitress was very attentive, helpful with suggestions, and the food was amazing as always. Love this place!"
"My wife and I have been here many times over the past 8-9 years and it is our 'go to' place when we have something to celebrate, or if we just need a 'pick-me-up' evening dinner.  The food is always excellent, the service is unsurpassed in my experience, and it is such an interesting place with all the Texas artifacts."
Took 2hrs to get seated on New Year's Eve.. However the service and food were worth the wait.
It's the best steak in town.. Best crab cake ever... Chunk of crab meat... Love it... Nice decoration for Christmas during holiday season...
"Very good...simply put. The service was top shelf Fo-Shizzle. That salad bar is epic. The Long wait spoke volumes about the longevity of its success obviously...hated waiting but who doesn't?  My steak, the t-bone was perfect. A lot of large high-end steak houses, not to mention any names but they start with an ""m"" and an ""r"" are just so-so... Which is a shame after dropping $50+ on a piece of beef. The Taste of Texas delivered however.  The only thing I'd recommend is that they add bacon to their Mac-n-cheese. I know I could have nabbed more for myself from that killer salad bar - my bad - but it's better if it's cooked in with the dish."
"This is a full dining experience . We out of towners got to experience real Texas hospitality, and the food was excellent! We chose our own steaks, tried the quail appetizer, and polished everything off with the snickers cheesecake. Then we didn't eat for 24h we were so full!"
Great place to go to.Steak here is great and you can even choose your own cut of meat too.Try the filet wrapped in bacon.  Great flavor and tenderness.Gotta love the salad bar that you can visit and the bread you can get.Love the atmosphere because it can be loud but its not too overpowering.You got to get here early because they do not take reservations and the lines can be long and sometimes 2+ hours.  The staff and service here is good as well. Friendly faces.I would recommend one of the steaks since they are all good but I had the filet.  Try it with the mac n cheese and get the quail skewers for appetizer.All good flavors and good food.
Food and service is absolutely amazing. The wait is definitely nothing to look forward to but once you have your meal you can almost understand why the wait is so crazy. I have never had a better filet. The manager Stephen was amazing as well. Came over and chatted with my husband and I regarding where he was from and then treated our whole table to dessert and thank us for waiting. I recommend going whenever you can!!!!!!!!!
"Houston is riddled with steak houses. During a recent business trip, I wanted to try the best steak around and was instantly pointed to Taste of Texas. Sounds legit enough. Like everything in Texas, this restaurant is HUGE. It's also very popular, so expect to wait at least an hour for a table, especially during a weekend evening. Thankfully, they have two bars, with the one in the back being much more accessible. They have your regular selection of beers and wine, along with a few local microbrews. Patrick D. suggested to the Karbach IPA and gave us a good history lesson on Houston's developing microbrew scene. He's a wonderful bartender and also poured me my first pint of Shiner Bock. Once seated, we headed straight for the salad bar, which is included with steak purchase. Typical selection of fresh veggies, dressings and toppings. HUGE blocks of cheese that will satisfy cravings of any cheese lover like me. To top that off, the cheese buns are mindblowing. The oversized dishes:- Texas Quail Bites ($15.95): Four skewers of grilled quail wrapped in bacon and served with jalapeno poppers. I'm a big fan of quail, and these were prepared perfectly. Very tender and flavorful. If you've never had quail before, this is a must!- Stuffed Mushroom Caps ($13.95): Six hollowed out mushroom caps stuffed with crab meat and brie. Absolutely outstanding. This is one of my favorite concoctions in general, but when you throw crab meat in there and use jumbo mushrooms, it's out of this world. - Center Cut Filet - 10 oz ($45.95): Tagged with a tracking number, labeled with a ""Certified Angus Beef"" pin, and served with creamy béarnaise sauce and your choice of side. This is not your average steak. I'm typically not a fan of steak, but this was top notch. I asked for medium well, which they got spot on. Not too red inside, yet still tender, juicy, and flavorful. A perfect choice if you want to try other items and get a medium sized steak. Of course, in Texas, this would be considered minuscule. - Steamed Lobster Tail ($19.95 as add-on): Delicately boiled and fresh out of the shell, topped with various herbs and served with a lemon and butter. When you have room to splurge, why not add it on? Makes for the perfect steak & lobster dinner.As if that wasn't enough, the server came out with the mammoth dessert platter, which featured 10 diabetes-infusing selections. I refused, but the sheer concept and size of a dessert platter made me drop my jaw. At the end of the night, I was incapable of doing anything but sleeping. The massive food coma that set on was unprecedented. Taste of Texas definitely let me indulge to the extent of my capacity."
"This place is pretty good, but I would rank it under both Pappas Bros and Ruth's Chris. I can understand the allure of picking out your own steak in theory, but in practice this took away from the feeling of a high class steak restaurant.In fact, the folks I went with commented more on the salad bar than the steak. It was also a little noisy and crowded for the price tag. Soft pass."
"By Far the best steak I have had in my life. The wait is long, but with their drinks, popcorn, and chips it went by quickly. Our waitress was a bit on the odd side, but I think she had too much going on. Once things calmed down, the service was good, and we couldn't have asked for a better 5 year anniversary dinner."
"Steak wasn't as good as I remembered from a year ago, I ordered the rib 16 oz. not bad. I brought back more than half my food for lunch the next day. But found fluffy white stuff in the stem of myBroccoli, pretty sure it's mold...so definitely not happy about spending so much on an establishment that did not properly clean the prepared dish...thoroughly disappointed"
"The food was Honestly delicious, I had slow roasted prime rib and it was so good,but the service was so poor. What happened is we asked for a paper napkin and we got it wet by ""CANDLE OILE"" I noticed that after I wiped  My daughter hands and mouth, so told the waitress, Then she brought us a dirty hot towel, I refused to use it.They did not apologize about all that."
"So apparently, they cater to alcohol intolerant people... I always order doubles, but because my mom blessed me with good skin, they will not allow me to drink anymore drinks. I'm sitting here with no drinks..."
I love this place. Best steak I've ever had. It's a little pricy but well worth it. The salad bar and the bread...!
"One of the best restaurants in Houston, the food is to die for. We have been to quite of few restaurants in 22 different countries and I would say this is the best steak I have ever had.  Excellent desert."
"Amazing!  After being born & raised in Houston, TX, I finally went to Taste of Texas.  I went at 3:30 pm on a Sunday.  Country and very Texas decor.  Our waiter was amazing and let us choose our steaks and showed us the kitchen.  The salad bar, which included traditional yeast rolls, jalapeño cornbread and a cheese roll also had fruit and big blocks of cheese.  It was hearty and tough to not overeat while waiting for our steaks.  My husband and I both ordered filets.  Mine was so tender and delicious covered in garlic butter.  One of the top 3 steaks I've ever had.  The sides were ok (garlic mashed potatoes and mac n cheese).  We also enjoyed ice cream in a carmel cookie basket. Have to mention the spiked Arnold Palmer from the bar was perfection. The manager stopped by and was very genuine in his interaction.  Top notch customer experience and food to rave about.  I will be back!"
"Amazing! Amazing everything...food, service, hospitality, all of it. Absolutely the best steak anywhere around. Melissa was our waitress, and she couldn't have been better. Thanks for a great evening!"
Great service. Steak is excellent. A nice salad bar that comes with the steaks. Bread basket is delicious. Go hungry!
"Whenever I have family or friends visit from out of town that want a ""Texas Steak"", I take them to Taste of Texas. Because, like the name implies, they have some really great, really Texan steaks. The establishment is beautiful with plenty of parking; it is a mix of Texas lodge house and classy restaurant with dim lighting and an overall private but lively atmosphere. My favorite part about ToT is their unlimited salad bar with any purchase of a steak! They keep the salad plates and vegetables ice cold so that they stay crisp and fresh; there is such a huge variety of toppings that you can add to the salad to make it into your own (sun-dried tomatoes, slightly sweetened crushed walnuts, different types of pasta salads etc.). They also have unlimited bread: jalapeno cornbread, a cheesy swirl bread, and regular dinner roll. Along with these breads comes a variety of spreads: Cinnamon butter, fruit jams, regular butter, and more. And, I cannot reiterate this enough, the bread is SO GOOD. It is fluffy, it is delicious, it is everything that bread should be, and when you add the cinnamon butter spread to the dinner roll? It's just heaven on your tongue. The reason why I give ToT 4 stars instead of 5 though is that their steaks, although fantastic, just aren't as fantastic as other steak-focused restaurants in Houston. Personally, i think they under-season their steaks a bit so that the flavor just isn't all there. The steak itself is cooked really well and the meat is always very juicy, but I just feel like it's missing something (I assume because they do not marinate their steaks beforehand, since they let you pick which steak you want). However, you can definitely taste the firewood grill that they may or may not use to cook the steaks, and it definitely is a Texan taste, which is why I continue to bring my friends and family here. Just don't expect the best steak of your life."
Would have to be the best steak we have ever eaten! Excellent service to match. Def no need to fill up on salad or bread for starters!
"Taste of Texas might have the best value in any steakhouse I've been to.To start off, there's a salad and bread bar where you can get as much as you like.  Salad options are great and the breads are always warm and soft.  Grab a roll with some cinnamon butter or honey butter.... Great way to start off the meal.As for the steaks, everything here is wet aged, which is a bummer, but the prices are nice.  The boo ordered a 16 ounce ribeye which was 37 dollars while i got the 24 ounce cowboy ribeye for 40.  These are good prices for a steakhouse that's considered near the upper end of steak houses.  Each order comes with a side so i got the asparagus with hollandaise sauce while the boo got sweet potato fries.  Each steak was cooked to order....... but with wet aged steaks, it's hard to get any great flavor.  Wet aged steaks are juicy.... but very bland.  It's unfortunate that Taste of Texas doesn't offer any dry aged steaks but pretty much only very few do.Taste of Texas felt like Texas Roadhouse if it was an upgrade.  I'll stick to Pappas Bros for my steaks in texas...... until i get my mini fridge and dry age my own steaks :-D"
"I love this place. It is a great dining experience and the food is always amazing.But explain to me why a restaurant that is so nice it has a dress code doesn't accept reservations? I was so excited to come here for my 21st birthday dinner, only to find that we could not make a reservation in advance and then got to the restaurant and was told it would be an hour wait. On a Wednesday evening. Consider me one very disappointed birthday girl."
"Pros- great buffet salad bar with a variety of dressings and warm breads- love the intimate interior with dim lights- service is GREAT! Our waitress continued filling our waters even after we paid. Normally servers forget about you after you've paid....- the meat is definitely the best of the best! I love that they provide various sauces to go with your meat- very clean restroom! They even have those nice thick napkins :) Cons- we felt a bit rushed out of the restaurant. Our waitress gave us the check without us asking for it- when we sat and talked for awhile after the meal I felt like the servers were surrounding our table and giving us a strong hint of ""okay you're done, can you get out now so we can seat others?""- very popular restaurant so it's quite loud and the front of the restaurant is crowded because of all the people waiting. Wish they had a clearer and bigger designated waiting area- parking is quite limited...had to park on the street"
Can't go wrong with Taste of Texas. Consistently good service and quality. Best steakhouse in Houston.
"This place will not disappoint - not only is the food great, but the ambiance as well. The salad bar is good enough to make the primary meal - it's just that good. The steak is cooked perfectly EVERYTIME, as is the chicken (gotten this on more than one occasion). The veggie plate is also a perfect meal. We have never eaten anything here we didn't enjoy. But, it has to be the steak that keeps me coming back (OK, that and the rolls). You are allowed to go to the back and pick your steak, which we like so we can pick just the right size. The desserts are fantastic; the pecan pie one of the best I have ever had!The service is great; and we usually have a good time. Unfortunately, we usually have a bit of a long wait, but it is not that unusual at a nice restaurant on the weekend in the  evenings.But, the BEST time of the year to go to eat at Taste of Texas has to be the Holiday Season - the Christmas decorations are fun and colorful. Warning, they don't do reservation during this time of year, so plan for a long wait."
"Best steaks in Houston and an outstanding salad bar to boot. They have a huge block of cheese and fresh, warm rolls and various flavored butters as well.  They have a wonderful collection of historic Texas items around the restaurant. For years, they have invited school children for a lunch and tour. Very generous & memorable. This is a great place for a special meal. If on a budget, you can order the salad bar and a grilled chicken breast on the side. It's delicious as well."
"The One Where Sandy Witness a Guy Choking on his Dinner. No joke... that really happened and the hemlic was performed and the ambulance showed up.  So yeah, a pretty dramatic dinner that night.  Or like my brother puts it ""a very expensive dinner for that guy.""Anyway, my mom loves Taste of Texas and we try to take her here for any special occasions like Mother's Day to be exact.  The atmosphere here is casual country.  For a high-end dining place, one can come in with jeans and boots and not feel out of place.  Yes, yes, I'm guilty of that for sure.Food wise - we always start off with their crab cake and they only serve one per order.  The one crab cake is actually enough to go around because you must keep in mind that their salad/bread bar is coming up next.  Their crab cake is very meaty with very little breading.  The salad/bread bar is amazing!  In fact, it's my favorite thing here.  You get to make your own salad, get a plate of fresh fruit with cheese (and they have two huge blocks of cheese for you to slice) and grab as many bread baskets as you like.  They also serve three different types of bread: regular roll, cheese roll, and jalapeno cornbread.  Now, FTW - their cinnamon butter.  Oh... yumm.... I can eat that with their regular roll all day, every day.  It's an awesome treat. Their unlimited salad bar comes with your entree.  If you're like my sister and brother-in-law, they add on a salad bar because they end up sharing a huge steak (16 oz ribeye to be exact).  Entree wise - Taste of Texas is rumored to be known for their ribeye.  In fact, everyone at my table always order that except for me.  I always end up with their prime rib (if they still have medium rare available) or their filet.  Regardless, their steaks are very good.  Do note that they do not take reservations and only seat complete (and I mean complete) parties."
"Pretty good! Ordered a medium rare t-bone with mashed potatoes and it was a little tougher than I would have liked, but not bad. The mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes. Overall, 4/5."
"Tonight was our 2nd time back since my last review.  We went in early May when my Inlaws visited, and tonight when my hubby's old boss came to town.  Our server was amazing, I had our 3mth old on my lap and was waiting for his daddy to finish his salad so I could trade out and get mine - and she offered to go get me a plate of salad!!! I've found my new fave dish 6oz bacon wrapped center cut filet with garlic butter and au gratin potatoes.  Totally shamazeballs.I absolutely love this place and will find any/every excuse to return!!"
I had the cowboy steak and it was excellent.  I have eaten at many top steak houses in Houston.  This place has the best steak hands down..
"Every time when im in town for business, this is where i go. Not once, i didnt have a good meal. Service is awesome, price is tight. Highly recommend to everyone."
"This is my new old favorite no-frills steakhouse. The salad bar is ridiculous.  It could be (and actually, it turns out is) a meal in itself.  Lettuces, ""salads"", pasta salads, bits and pieces, olives, croutons, peppers, onions, fruits, red things, blue things, old things, new things.  GIANT BLOCK OF CHEESE.Yes, these are all items found at the salad bar.  You'll be so confused with the selection (ref: consumer hyper-choice) that you'll think you're at a buffet and want to come back for seconds.Also with the salad bar are their rolls and corn bread.  Now they're kind of the dark-horse of the meal.  You're probably thinking -- no big deal a roll is a roll, but then BLAMMO, they hit you up with their apple butter.Now the apple butter shouldn't be totally unfamiliar because when you sat down, you got a plate of toast rounds with butter and apple butter but BLAMMO, now it's an all you want mistake waiting to happen.And OH SNAP -- you haven't even eaten your steak yet!I've only ever had a problem once with the steak there and it only took them a cowboy minute to fix.  They don't typically go crazy with the seasoning, letting the flavor of the meat shine on it's own.  After the meal they have super nice cinnamon coffee which is a real treat.  It's different and tasty.Taste of Texas is always pretty crowded.  I typically wait 20-30 minutes so it's fun to send an advance party to grab a number and waste some time on their phone or whatnot while the rest of your party gets there.Now, admittedly this isn't The Palm or another legendary steakhouse BUT it is a super good steakhouse serving up consistently good pieces of meat, cooked to order with a HUGE helping of Texas hospitality."
"Get serious if you want nothing but the best. Excellent Service. Great Food. Cool Atmosphere. They got the system workin'.  It was good ten years ago, and it's the same quality today. That's hard to do!"
Great salad bar and sides! Steak is Golden Corral quality. Not a steak place. Kinda like a bonanza if you remember those places.? Great staff and good service.
"The food was amazing but you get so much!   We made the mistake of ordering an appetizer, not knowing that you get the salad bar plus a huge meal... we'll know better for next time!   I found the atmosphere odd.   It was expensive, the ""look"" of the restaurant you would think it would be more of an upscale restaurant, but when we arrived the wait was more than an hour, there were kids every where, and the wait area was pretty laid back.   Anyway, if I spent that much on food, I expect a bit nicer atmosphere.   Overall, I think we'll be back; we'll just be more prepared on what to expect.   The food was certainly worth the money."
Steak - Porterhouse & Cowboy cooked perfectly and it was delicious.Ambiance is great. Friendly staff & our waiter Brandon was so nice and helpful. Cheese bread 4/5Salad Bar 4/5I think Taste of Texas is the place to enjoy some really perfectly crafted steaks.
Always a long wait for ok food. It could be that they give you so much popcorn and drinks as you wait it's hard to be hungry when you finally do get seated.
"Wow this place is REALLY busy! Word of advice, if you want to come here for dinner, come at 3:30pm (right when they open) and put you name on the list so you can get one of those waitlist cards and let them know what time you intend on coming back. So, when you come back at 7pm and the wait is 2hours long, you actually get on the fast pass line and only wait about 30mins. Yep, saved us a TON of time and they do give popcorn and chips while you wait! When we finally got seated and ordered, we went to the salad bar, nothing too special (fogo de chao has much better selection). They had a variety of dressings but as far as salad toppings, they were just the typical salad bar stuff. The rolls were pretty good but the cornbread was kind of old when I had it. The cinnamon butter was delicious, and so was the regular butter. For appetizers, we had the crab cake and the stuffed shrimp. The crab cakes were okay. They were generous with the crab but the flavor wasn't great. It was eggy and tangy for some reason and the tartar sauce that it came with didn't complement the flavor either. The stuffed shrimp was pretty good, they used jumbo shrimp so they were decent portions.For entree, we got the cowboy steak, tomahawk steak, and the grilled tuna. Let me start by saying that all of our food was overcooked. We all requested medium rare and came out with about medium well. This made such a big difference in our food. It's pretty disappointing especially considering how this place is known for their steaks yet they can't cook it right. It was cool that we got to pick our own steaks so you know exactly what you'll be eating. The tuna had a nice smoky taste but it was lacking any other flavor. The french fried onions on top of it was pretty good and was basically the only thing giving it taste. The pineapple salsa that it came with was too tangy and didn't really go well with the tuna. The cowboy steak was pretty good, highly recommend the garlic butter! It made the steak taste a whole lot better. I wish they were more generous with that, or perhaps we could have asked for more because it only touched half of our steak and the other half was a bit plain. The tomahawk steak was HUGE! it was pretty legit, flavor wise it tasted better than the cowboy steak too. (or maybe they just put more garlic butter hah!)Overall, this place was pretty good but it was quite pricey, definitely not a great value. They had a nice huge selection of wines and the one we got went very well with our meal. I don't think I'll be coming back here because I don't think their steaks are THAT good to come back and spend a lot on it again. Oh wells, it was a good meal!"
"I checked yelp to find out a great steakhouse in the town. I saw their reviews that are many positive recommendations from yelpers. My hubby and I went to try the place right away. Definitely it was right decision. Their steaks are tender and salad bar must be tried without doubt.I had such good experience becuase server was knowledgeable and helpful to recommend their steaks to us. At the meantime, She knew we were celebrated birthday, she gave us a free cake and picture which she took for us. It was amazing service. I will recommend some friends to try this place. You're deserved to get 5 stars."
"Never had a bad experience here, for a business luncheon ask to sit in the wine room as it is the most conducive for that, otherwise extremely loud at lunch.  Dinner seems less stressed.  The food is superior to their counterparts, but it is the wait staff that shines every time.  Attentive staff that actually go above and beyond must be their mantra. Lunch for two $60.The baked brie serves two, the crabcakes actually have crab in them, not the imitation stuff and the pecan pie melts in your mouth.Parking a challenge as it fills up to the max early on weekdays.  There is a person riding through the lot on a golf cart, not sure if it is for security purposes or to assist some folks to get to the front door."
Had Robbie Robertson as our server and he gave us perfect service. The steak was the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back!
Taste of Texas was everything we wished it was. We had a layover on our trip to Costa Rica. Our flight was leaving in Houston so we had 3hrs to kill. We found this place in city and it was amazing. The salad bar is great. They cool the plates and give you a lot of options to build. We ordered the Qual for an appetizer which was so delicious. Than for our Entry I got the 24 oz Cowboy steak cooked medium. I added the home made blu cheese sauce and it was hands down the best steak I've ever tasted in my life. It was cooked perfect. Afterwards my burps smelled like hell. But it was well worth it. My girl got the Filet Mignon with Oscar sauce and a loaded Potato. She said it was the best steak of her life as well. The owner came out chatted to us and bought dessert for us. Such a great experience. We were so stuffed but we couldn't turn down the gesture. I got the Texas traditional Pecan Pie A la mode and she got the Snicker pie. The bill wasn't bad at all. Would love to go back.
"As awesome as the steaks are in many cases my family and I find ourselves going just for the salad bar. The best salad bar ever! Three words: fresh, fresh, fresh! The veggies have a good variety, the salad toppings are scrumptious. The whole family goes coo-coo over the fresh breads that you serve yourself with cinnamon butter - not to mention the blocks of cheese. Did I say fresh?"
"I haven't been throwing around the ""5-star"" lately because I feel only the very best deserve it. Taste of Texas is worthy. The atmosphere is great, the service is top notch, the salad bar is rivaled by few, and the steaks are spot on. Every time. I've been here 3 times, only for fancy occasions because of the price.  It is expensive, but for those special moments it's worth it.  I've never had a bad meal. I've never had bad service. And I've never left feeling upset. The steaks are amazing. Their drinks are tasty and have just the right amount of alcohol.  Their salad bar is so awesome. Only words. Oh and I need to mention the jalapeño corn bread? Smack yo momma good. Even if you aren't a red meat eater, their chicken is delicious. Really the only negative thing about this place is the lack of intimate dining. It's pretty open and loud, so know that going in. You will enjoy this place.  SYOY"
"The Weekly Yelp mentioned my ""Steak in Cow Country"" list (thanks, Farrah A), and I realized I had never reviewed the quintessential Houston steakhouse. Unacceptable! It'll be a quick review, but the bottom line is STEAK + TEXAS = TASTE OF TEXAS.With apologies to Pappas and Killen's, Taste of Texas is the first place that comes to mind when visitors ask for Texas steak. Ambiance is a huge deal here, and if your guests are looking for fine country-western, look no further than Taste of Texas.The salad bar is, well, phenomenal. It's tempting to get full on the cornbread, rolls, honey, and flavored butter alone. The cheese block is incredibly fun. I like fruit on my salads, and you can top to your heart's content here. Plus, the entree can always be taken home should you get too full on filler. Thinking ahead!Steak is solidly good, but not otherworldly, here. One neat part is the ability to choose your own steak. The waiter will take you back to the selection for the day, and you can point and choose.I always get the ribeye, which comes on a sizzling metal platter (in the shape of a cow), doused with garlic butter. It looks drool-worthy but tastes slightly less than divine, which is how I've found all the steaks to be here. It's unexplainable, and unavoidable. My dad loves the prime rib and portabello mushroom; my brother goes T-bone.The one-star ding is for, besides the A- steak, the crazy insane wait times. Do not even attempt to come here during holidays, lest you feel the desire to wait triple-digit minutes. There are no reservations: it's all first-come, first-serve. Though the dining room is huge, the crowds are huge. Free sodas and popcorn are available to tide you over, but it's a frustrating wait."
First time here. Enjoyed every bit of my giant Tomahawk steak. Loved picking the meat myself too. Recommend doing it. Remember you can't go here and nickel and dime the menu. Go when you are ready to splurge.
"I used to really really really love coming to Taste of Texas. The food was delicious, the portions were large and the service was excellent. The last couple of times I've been back they have disappointed me in at least one way. Either the food is good and the service mediocre or visa versa. I miss the consistency in both service and food that Taste of Texas once took pride in."
"I was away on business and my wife just happened to tag along, so I tried to make it as ""fun"" as possible for her.  A coworker suggested that I try taste of texas.  We took the trip out there and was happy to see that it was a pretty sizable restaurant.  We entered and were seated immediately.... They have A LOT of friendly employees.They pulled out an iPad and showed us their ""virtual"" wine list, which was pretty cool.  My wife ordered a filet and i went with the bone in rib eye.  They waiter took me to the back room and allowed me to pick my steak... pretty cool.Included with the steak was access to the salad bar, which had all types of breads, veggies, spreads and etc.... a nice touch.We got our steaks and they were nicely cooked.  Taste wise... they were good for a wet aged steak.  I prefer the dry aging process.  From a service perspective, it is the best experience I ever had with a restaurant this size!"
"Taste of Texas is really hard to beat. The service was great, the wine is great, the steaks are great, and it's a very unique experience. If you don't know the deal, you pick out your steak on the menu, then you are escorted to the kitchen and you literally pick out your steak from the rows and rows of steaks available! You get a tag number when you pick it out so that upon delivery, you know you've got the right meat ;)The grilled quail bites are delicious, but I wasn't a fan of their stuffed shrimp because they're so deep fried. If you get an appetizer, my advice would be to stick with the quail. The steaks are incredibly tender - I got the 8 oz filet and you could have cut it with a butter knife.Top knotch!"
One of the best restaurants in Houston. Every visit has always been perfect. Yes there might be a wait but the waiting area has complimentary drinks and snacks. Now when you do manage to sit down the staff is very well trained and courteous. Then comes the fun part where you go to the back and select your steaks and as always cooked to your choice and perfection. Not once have I ever had a bad experience here and highly recommend at least to try the place out once.
"This place is insanely awesome!  I've been to this location approximately 9-10 times over the past 4 years and every visit was a true treat.  The steaks are cooked to perfection, the salad bar is a meal in and of itself, the waitstaff is attentive, professional, and knowledgeable.  The manager always comes by to chat, the ambiance is wonderful.  I have no complaint and I am one picky customer!  Nothin' but love here.  :)"
"I love love love love love love Taste of Texas. Forever and always. I will always sing its praises and take my out-of-state friends here (when finances are cush). I know that my opinion is biased because I haven't really eaten at other high-quality steak houses in Houston (like Pappas Bros.), but my dumb love for this place will prevent me from going anywhere else for prime rib, as long as I can help it. My stubborn loyalty even made my turn my nose down at the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, where I constantly sang Taste of Texas' praises in my head. Yeah, I was THAT girl.This is what you can expect when you go, every time:- A long wait during normal meal times. They don't take reservations for... 15(?) people or under, so you'll just have to wait. But they have a large area for waiting, including complimentary soda, popcorn and chips. You must try to resist the temptation of filling up on these, because the best is yet to come- A truly ""Texan"" experience. From the interior decor to the Southern hospitality, this place has everything Texan to offer (I mean all of the positives, hehe)- Friendly, courteous, knowledgeable waiters. Every time I've been, we've had nothing but excellent service and have been treated kindly and professionally, no matter what the occasion- An incredible salad bar. I know it's just a salad bar, but I would come here to eat the salad alone, and I am NOT a salad junkie. This is the occasion where quality is better than quantity; it may be small, but I love their selection of greens, veggies, pasta salads and beans. Chilled plates, fresh and delicious ingredients, incredible (and fresh) salad dressings (my favorite are the cilantro vinaigrette or the cactus sauce). Add two chunks of cheese that you can carve to your heart's desire, along with freshly-made buns and breads with an assortment of flavored butters and jellies, and you've got yourself an unbeatable salad experience. My favorite salad dressing is the cilantro vinaigrette. When I lived in Cali, I would have dreams of the vinaigrette. Oh CV, how I love thee- The best prime rib you will ever have. I am not kidding. They dry-age the prime rib for 20(?) days, and you have the most flavorful, earthy prime rib flavor. They pair it with au jus and creamy horseradish sauce, along with the unlimited salad bar and a choice of one of their many hand-crafted sides. When I go with someone, we share the smallest size prime rib and walk away stuffed and satisfied- Great for special occasions. If it's your birthday, they will give you a free dessert, as well as a Polaroid picture of the event inserted in their Taste of Texas card. I highly recommend a dessert that includes their Blue Bell cinnamon ice cream, specifically made for Taste of Texas (you cannot buy it retail ANYWHERE)- Reasonably-priced. The last time I went with my mom and the hubbs, I was feeling under the weather so I ordered the salad bar and soup. I believe my meal only cost $12. I mean, really, it's only $2 more than Sweet Tomatoes, and the quality is ten times better. Definitely worth it!!Well, I guess that's all I can say without sounding like a broken record. I am so glad my family and I are going tomorrow. We already ate it last week, and I'm already ready for round two!!"
"All I can say is wow! Everything about Taste of Texas is top notch, but it's rustic enough to not make you feel like a snob for eating there. The prices are pretty high, but you get a high quality meal...and plenty of it! Any place that has their own exclusive Blue Bell ice cream flavor should be on your radar!"
"This is our favorite restaurant! We pop in sometimes just for the award winning salad bar, or celebrate special events here, and the the service, quality and total experience is always impeccable! A few favorites: salad bar is a must! Crab cake, Mac & Cheese, Pecan Pie - I'll stop here but I could surely go on.  I love their friendly and professional staff, and manager Norman is simply the best, as well as other managers who I can't call by name. Oh, last thing, prepare to wait. It's a popular spot and they don't take reservations. In the meantime though, there are refreshments and snacks while you wait.The rustic design and Texan relics on the wall make for a very unique, cabin-like ambiance. If you have folks in town, bring them here. Ciao!"
"This place is 110% overrated. I've had way better steaks. I love the concept and even their process, but the finished product did not knock my socks off and that's what I expect when coughing up that much moolah and from a place with that much hype. No plan to return. My date that evening had no complaints though...that's the only reason you got 3 stars."
"There's a lot of hype and great reviews for this place, so we decided to try it out for birthday dinner.  None of us had ever been there, so it was all a new experience for us.  We were seated promptly on a Wednesday evening, so that was fantastic.  While we were waiting for the rest of our party, my husband and I heard the server talking to the table next to us, and one of the questions is if the customer wanted to pick out his own steak - porterhouse. My husband was excited about the possibility of picking out his steak since we thought it would have been pretty neat.  In any case, maybe we went on a bad night because our server, while nice, was very busy.  We waited a while to actually order, which the order was taken by another server (our server was occupied), and we weren't offered the opportunity to choose our meats - husband was disappointed he wasn't offered the opportunity to pick his porterhouse.  We were there for almost 2 hours, and they didn't refill the soda once (soda was about 1/3 left, but it was watered down due to ice, and no offer or mention to refill). The food, overall, was good - excellent salad bar.  Crab cake appetizer opinion was mixed. A member of our party was disappointed in his burger (he's a big burger fan, but only finish half of his burger), but we all agreed the steaks were good, ""cowboy"" was more favored over porterhouse.  Since we were there for a birthday dinner, we did receive compliment dessert and photo for memory, which was very nice. I'm very big on service, especially at nicer restaurants, and can make or break my entire impression of a restaurant. I'd have to say I was disappointed. While the food was good, service wasn't terrible, but wasn't good either.  Would I come back? I'm not sure - I think Taste of Texas is mostly hype. I still prefer my steaks from Flemings."
"My family and I love coming here. The food and service is worth the long wait. While you wait they offer complimentary chips, salsa, sodas and drinks. The service is excellent. Management is great! You can tell because there are more than 2 of them checking and running everything. We went on Fathers Day and the wait was out the door and it was hot. They had these huge fans and snacks outside for the people waited. It was packed and they were very organized. That reflects good management. The food is excellent. Our waiter Gus was fantastic. No complaints. The price is right. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it can't compare to the steaks at Ruth Chris Steakhouse. We will be back."
"We came here for a b-day, and a few times after...top notch for steaks especially when you get to choose which one, very tender and juicy. Loved the salad bar though which I think is probably my most favorite."
"My favorite steak place, hands down. Impressive wine selection too. The owners love God, promote family, and support our military/veterans. I could spend hours looking at all the Texas-themed memorabilia/antiques/artifacts in Taste of Texas. I've never had a less than perfect meal here."
"This is my favorite steak place.  The service is superb and the ranch style decoration just prepares you to enjoy a good steak.Amazingly, the salad bar is also great.  They aren't just about the steak.All the steaks are angus beef and are always cooked exactly as I instructed.  The juices are kept and just using the garlic butter topping lets the meat shine.The meat is high quality and the flavor is good.  There isn't much more you need.Lines can be long on the weekends, so they have a massive waiting area with free drinks and snacks."
"I had been to Taste of Texas at least 3 times before last night and most of them had been pretty nice meals. However, I was not very happy with yesterday's visit. We got there and found out the wait was 1:30-2:00 hours- that was fine. When we got seated, we ordered right away. Both my boyfriend and I had salad bar options but we only got half a plate of salad each and shared 3 pieces of bread.  The stuffed mushrooms were great. My boyfriend's New York Strip Sirloin was good but we thought my Grilled Tenderloin Medallions were okay. There was a pinch of flavor but not much else. I did not touch the 6oz medallions and ended up eating the asparagus, tomato and onion strings. My boyfriend did not finish his meal since we both wanted to save room for dessert. I love bread so since my meal was subpar, I got some bread from the Salad Bar and put it on our table. This is what made me the most upset:We asked for 3 to go boxes. The server asked if we wanted everything boxed up.She asked, ""Do you want the bread?""We said, ""Yes!"" to both. I would've packed everything up myself. When I opened the to go boxes up for lunch today... not all of the food was there. Why would you ask if I wanted it all box up and not give it to us?We also ordered a creme brûlée for dessert, which tasted off. I am a huge desserts person and I don't even think I ate 10% of that dish. The strawberries were not sweet either. Since the dessert was eh, I was definitely looking forward to the bread tomorrow (which did not even get packaged up). Overall, I tipped the waitress 25% for packing our food and taking care of us but I regret it now seeing that our food was not even fully packed in and the food was not good."
"Love love loved this place!  Found it on yelp and was not disappointed.  Great service. Great food.  Our server was fabulous and showed us everything for a first time visitSalad bar-amazing!  Hot bread, lots of choices and the plates are ice cold.  Steaks-take it all in and pick your own!  How much fun!  Take the tag with you so you have a little memory.  It was a fabulous hand picked steak.  They ask you exactly how you want it seasoned.  Those that say they don't season it enough---well you didn't ask for it!!!!Desert-ah-mah-zing.  So many to pick from but go with their signatures.  You won't be disappointed.  Wine was great-maybe a little overpriced but that's what happens when you buy a bottle in the restaurant.  A great place with a lot of Texas history.  Loved it!  Will visit again"
"This place is undeniably unique. From the beginning, if you have a wait you will get to sit in their waiting area with free soft drinks, popcorn, and chips and salsa. When you sit down, a complimentary appetizer is given to you. Then, with an entree you get unlimited trips to the salad bar. The center cut filet is always cooked perfectly for me. The pecan pie is delicious. Not only that, the service is always perfect. I love the Texas history artifacts spread throughout the restaurant. Also, they make any event (anniversaries, birthdays) special. I have recommended this place to everyone visiting the Houston area and all of them come back and have said this is their favorite place to go."
"bomb.com! If I had the cash flow, I'd be here multiple times to try everything out.Our waiter Carlos was awesome and very helpful."
"I have been coming to this restaurant with my family since I was in a baby carrier (over 21 years) and it has been my top pick of restaurants for as long as I can remember. Anytime there is a celebration in our family, Taste of Texas is our go to place. The food is delicious and the service is always exceptional. The prices are on the higher side but the food is worth it in my opinion. Their determination to give guests the best experience possible seems really genuine and the managers are always coming around to make sure everything is running smooth. I look forward to coming here for many more years."
"You cannot beat this place for value and the quality is quite high as well.  Great beef, great great service.  They really take care of you here.  The salad bar and it's breads, along w/ desserts (the pecan pie ...!), are also true standouts."
"One of our all time favorite restaurants. We LOVE this place; for date night, for special occasions, or just for a good steak! The hospitality is unmatchable. The salad bar is always a hit and I love how they have snacks and drinks set up for self service while you wait. Cannot wait for another Taste of Texas night!!!"
"Very long wait, no reservation... But worth it... There is a waiting area with soft drink, pop corn, and chips and salsa self serve. Bar area too... Its very welcoming for people visiting Texas. Had the beat mushrooms stuffed crabs. The shrimps too. Our waiter was awesome  very friendly and quick service. Left cellphones on the table and found them. Very uptown upscale place. You et a real the as experience. All beef is Angus certified. Very well cooked, crafted, and filling. Salad bar is simple and not a lot of variety. At champ. Will definitely go back."
"If you order a steak from the special steak section, u get unlimited salad and bread that you fix yourself from the salad bar which they kept stocked and boy that cilantro salad dressing was so tasty and the cheese rolls with that cinnamon butter was yummy! The waiter gives you an option to pick your steaks at the butcher area prior. I had a tomahawk steak ($60) and man ... that sucker was huge! Juicy too for medium well. Nice atmosphere. Get there as soon as they open cause they get packed pretty quick especially during the weekend. They start taking customers before they even open. We and couple people got there a couple minutes before 3p and by the time they opened we had already ordered and were eating our salads. Service was great. Waiter was attentive and quick. Desserts were huge ... enough for 2 people. Expect to shell at least $200 for two people."
"Came here for a rainy Sunday night steak with the bf and only waited for about 15 minutes to be seated. Even though we only waited for 15 minutes, I definitely hit up some of that free popcorn in the waiting room.The salad bar they have is incredibly fresh. The spinach, tomatoes, and cucumbers that they have are all basically farm-fresh, some of the best veggies I've had. The bread that they have is pretty great, but skip the cornbread, it's super dry. Their cinnamon butter + dinner roll is AMAZING, and yeah I ate way too much bread before eating a pound of steak :|I ordered the 16 oz ribeye, and my bf got the 6 oz center cut. Oh man, that center cut is tiny and that ribeye is huge (we definitely shared). The ribeye was kind of inconsistent; some bites were very tough and some were perfectly tender, some of it was completely unsalted and other parts were very well seasoned. The toughness was a turn-off for me, but overall it was kind of a pretty-good but not perfect steak experience. The center cut is incredibly tender, like melt-in-your-mouth tender. For my side, I got the Texas Au Gratin Potatoes, and they were very creamy and delicious, but definitely heavy. We also had a side of the green beans which were good, fresh, and crisp.Taste of Texas is pretty good, but I know for a fact that there are better steakhouses in Houston, so I'll be trying others before returning here."
"yay today is my birthday!TLDR(too long didn't read):Food was 3.5/5, almost borderline above average food, recommend steaks at a steakhouse!Ambience was 3.5/5, texas embodied in a restaurant!Service 3.5/5Price 3.5/5of course I want to go somewhere nice, and after much careful research and great recommendations I picked The Taste of Texas. sounds awesome, right? we arrived around 8:45 pm Tuesday, and surprisingly there was no wait, and we were seated immediately and took our drink orders.the place is very clean and grand with Texan paraphernalia. I got root beer, which came in a bottle by Saint Arnold, I wasn't a fan. I carefully ordered the cowboy steak (who wouldn't want to eat like a cowboy??) with a side of steak fries and macaroni and cheese ( probably not the best combination but who doesn't love starch) you also get access to the huge salad bar in the back (which wasn't advised of the location and I was looking around aimlessly until I was escorted to the salad bar, revealing an assortment of different greens, condiments (tomato+mozzarella, quinoa, vast variety of all the fixins!) and a nice heated drawer filled with cornbread (which was not that great, dry, tasted very odd, as most cornbreads i've had are), a regular dinner roll (which was fantastically traditional) and finally the best one of all a cheesy rolled bun that tasted deliciously succulent! if i didn't know i had 24oz of meat to eat, i would have eaten 2 more of those cheese rolls. they also had little tubs of a whipped honey cinnamon butter, which was nice, and another type of butter, and assortment of honey. i  shamelessly walked back to my table with my crammed basket of bread and overflowing salad plate. about 15 minutes later after stuffing my face of that amazing asiago roll, our entrees come rolling out on heated plates. my steak has a gratuitous dab of bleu cheese butter, melting down the side, curiously touching my steak fries, which were by the way largely average (my expectations shouldn't be high for fries, right?), and next to my humongous rectangular plate, a steaming hot, pale yellowed panko breadcrumb topped macaroni and cheese. of course i go for the steak first! I saw into my steak with the chubby steak knife provided, and my excitement dulls a little as i see my steak has been overcooked into the medium/medium-well temperatures even though i asked for medium rare. juices pour out and i indulge in the first bite. my mouth fills with tangy blue cheese and savory meat juices. this steak is pretty good! but as i worked on it a little more, I realized my meat was unevenly cooked, where the outerparts were more rare, and the fat wasn't as rendered down as i would have liked it. the macaroni and cheese was creamy, cheesy, with the crispy topping, nothing else to be expected! and since it's my birthday, they brought a huge platter of their desserts which included key lime pie, pecan pie, apple dumplings, mousse.. and since i'm a sucker for apple pie, i had to get the apple dumplings !! my favorite flavored vanilla ice cream and a soft biscuit dough topped with pecans blanketing soft apples, it was sinfully comforting. overall the food is leaning against the borderline of average and above average. i would come back only on extremely special occasions, this place is definitely a delightful spoil for your beefy desires."
"Everything is bigger in Texas!!! Why is Texas flag so big by the way? lol So I have to travel to Houston, Texas couple weeks ago, and I never been to Taxes before, and one of my goal was hopefully get to see a fat guy eat the 72 oz steak, sadly I didn't see any fat guy wanted to eat the 72 oz steak. lol So now, let's talk about Taste of Texas since I get that out of the way. :0)This place is really Texan, everything is old hardwood, there is a big bear by the front host stand, and a statue of a cowboy standing outside, not sure who it is, maybe some famous cowboy? This place to me is very different, because after you decided to order what type of steak you like on the menu, the waiter brought you back to their kitchen, and you get to pick which size of the meat you like, crazy right? lol I'll gotta tell you, some of the steak are huge, I can't believe is for people, is like a size of the half of the cow. lol I ordered the 24 oz Ribeye, and the reason why I ordered that is because the biggest steak I had ever ordered was 16 oz, and they have 22 oz, 24 oz, 36 oz, 48 oz, and go on and on, and yes, they can cut you as big as you wish!!! So I thought I never order 24 oz before, I will tried it, and to warn you all, unless you can eat a lot, don't do it. lol Because ordering the steak comes with salad bar, which is pretty big, I cannot finish my steak, I came close to, but didn't make it. lol So....good, but I had better in NY, and that is why I'm giving it 4 stars, still high up there tho, will I be back? Of course!!!"
I've had steak here several times and it was great. I particularly enjoy the soup and salad bar for lunch. The potato soup is so good that I like to eat it slowly and enjoy every single spoonful. The staff is very hospital. This is a very nice establishment; great for client meetings.
"The wait was the usual, 45 to an hour long. The wait wasn't bad because the wait area had free sodas, chips & salsa, and popcorn. The food was amazing. I would post pictures but was too hungry."
"About a week or 2 ago, I sent and email on the Taste of Texas website. I was trying to get my gift card redeemed through their store. Unfortunately, the gift cards are only usable through the restaurant.I left a note and left my information. It probably was not more than an hour and I got a call back. I spoke with Lindsay [sp] who was very wonderful!She let me know that my husband can come by the restaurant and use his gift card to get the 4 steaks [ribeye] and garlic sauce that he likes, which would be about the amount in total of our gift card.She said all he needed to do was go to the bar and they would accommodate him. She told me when she would be working and I told hubby to go in those days to give her a special thank you from me for being so patient, courteous, and kind!Thanks again for having superb customer service!Michele Brown"
"Was referred to this establishment by a few clients and was not disappointed.  First of all its very nice without the upscale foo foo feeling.  Awesome sald bar with very good toppings, great steak selection and they ask if I wanted to pick the piece or the butcher, sides were amazing."
"The Steak was nice and tender.. I picked my own steak which was great. I didn't care for the Cream cheese Jam however, The Service was A1.  Meet a Hoosier being from Indiana was great"
Amazing.  Their steak is cooked to perfection and their service is top notch.  Not to mention the salad bar; it has everything you need!  The waiting is the only thing that sucks because they don't take reservations (and they're always packed!) but there is a waiting section with a bar as well as free soda/popcorn/nachos.  Absolute favorite steak house in Houston!
"We dined here because Texas is supposed to have the best steak. I think this place was average. My husband got their prime rib but felt it tasted okay, probably because it had too much charcoal coating. I couldn't stop eating their cheese bread with their cheese/jam dip! It was something I never had before in NJ! Staff was great. Nothing but a typical steakhouse."
Always amazing. Not surprising everyone in other reviews says the restaurant was recommended to them. You will love the food and the experience.
I love the waiting room! It's such a great idea.My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary ! It was more than perfect . BEST STEAK IN TEXAS !!!!
The best salad bar and steaks in town. Yummy cheese rolls and corn bread.  I could eat the salad bar for lunch or dinner any day.
"Not long time to wait, very lucky!!good service and polite everyoneThey don't have wifi is not good for travelerbut meal still perfect!!they give us a picture we were cow boy hat very touch;)"
"Wonderful food and service! It's a bit pricey at first glance, but trust me, it's worth it.I ordered the center cut filet with garlic butter, and it was the best steak I've ever eaten.Highly recommend this place!"
"Normally it's a great family steak house. But tonight 4 was in my group and we all ordered steak. We all ordered med rare and rare. The two of us got the order on the steaks right and the other 2 came out well done. They apologized, asst Mgr included but we had someplace else we needed to be so of course couldn't wait nor did we want too.  So with the price and special occasion it didn't end too well. We will give it one more try. And that's it.PattiP"
"We went here for some serious steak, and we got serious steak! This restaurant has a pretty unique dining experience which I really appreciated. When we walked in we were given a number and led to the ""waiting area"" which is its own large room with a bar and ample seating. Tea, chips & salsa, and a large popcorn machine are all available free of charge to munch on while you wait. After being seated you can go to their butcher (yes they have their own butcher!) where you can pick out your cut of meat. Any steak order gives you access to their salad bar where they have fresh baked breads with homemade spreads. Their cinnamon butter is marvelous. It makes whatever you spread it on taste just like a Cinnabon roll. No joke.I split a 30 oz Tomahawk (rib-eye with bone in) with a side of Au Gratin potatoes. It. Was. Sublime. The steak was thick cut, well marbled, and perfectly cooked medium rare giving it a very rich and juicy taste. The potatoes were equally fabulous with just the right amount of cheese. Somehow after that feast I found some room for dessert with their Key Lime Pie. As with the rest of the meal it was excellent. The mousse was light and fluffy and the key lime was just tart enough to balance out the sweetness from the graham cracker crust. Really there wasn't a single thing I could complain about even if i wanted to. From the decor to the service to the quality of the food, everything was top shelf. 5 star rating well earned."
"Years ago, M would always bring me food back from here, but I have never stepped my foot inside this place until last December. I always pictured the inside of this place as some swanky place, but instead it was like this massive space with separate section throughout the restaurant and just the complete opposite of what I was picturing all those years.Since it was during the holidays, they were loaded up with decorations, I am wondering, where do they store all this stuff....because it was tons of things, including paintings all around that are holiday theme.Anyways, our waitress, can't remember her name, I should check my receipt, but she's super perky, you could tell she was working hard for a good tip. She's helpful and great - totally appreciate those qualities.We had tea, they have a very limited variety of tea, M got a citrus black tea and I got rooibos, since there were only 3 options available. Very limited.M got the salad bar as a meal and I got a medium rare, but closer to the rare side of the Center Cut 6 oz with the optional bacon wrapped and filet oscar.The steak came out in between medium rare to a light medium temperature and the filet oscar, which I got because I was curious about their crab cake, but opted for the steak topper with 2 ounce jumbo crab cake and hollandaise sauce. I have asked for the hollandaise sauce to be on the side. The crab cake was a bit too buttery for my taste, which overpowered the natural sweetness of how a good crab should taste. I ate one bite of the steak and that was enough. Not that it was a bad steak, but I can't eat that much meat in one sitting, especially red meat.I was full on my salad and my fully dressed baked potato. I haven't had a baked potato in ages. The salad bar is really limited, but I want to say I was obsessed with their miniature loaf of bread. Besides it just being cute, it was super fluffy and of course, love how it is kept warm in the bread containment. The jalapeno cornbread was a disappointment, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.The other round roll was okay, so out of the three, the mini loaf of bread was the best one.M was obsessed with the cinnamon butter.We didn't get any dessert, except we ate fresh fruit from the salad bar.I would come back here for the salad bar, not for the steak."
"Let me qualify this post by saying I've been to some very nice five star Steakhouses/Restaurants, Capital Grille, Ruth Chris, Charley's, Shula's,etc.- Taste of Texas isn't at that level, however, the overall experience isn't that far behind.  We visited Houston for the 3rd Annual James Harden ProCamp and after driving back to the hotel after the last day, my wife and I decided to treat my son to a Texas steak, last year we came out here we did the Pappa Trio  experience & left Texas without trying a steak. I'm glad we did not make that mistake twice. As soon as we entered the restaurant everyone was so hospitable, smiling faces, asking if we needed anything while leading us to the complimentary chips & salsa, popcorn, soda, tea room. I'm a big golf fan, so I was pleased to see the final few holes of the PGA on the TV.  The hostess told us the wait time was 25-30 mins. so I was pleasantly surprised when we actually got seated within the specified time. The ambiance is exactly what I would expect from a true Texas Resturant, a lot of historic relics, flags, oversized stuffed bears, classic riffles,  true Texas. The actual dining experience was phenomenal staring with Colby L., our expert wait staff. Colby expertly explained the Taste of Texas dinner experience, starting with ""selecting""  your steak, to the salad/bread, to the ""free"" liter refill of your beverage, and finally the wide variety of deserts that we just couldn't refuse although we where absolutely stuffed."
"Taste of Texas, we finally meet again! Years ago, I tried to dine here on a weekend night, and was given a 2 hour wait time for a party of 2. As the wise Sweet Brown said, ain't nobody got time for that!  Since then, people have raved about this place so incessantly that I was like, okay maybe I'm missing out. My BFFL and I planned a dinner and movie date night to spend some much needed QT together. I advised that we go early, around 5 PM, to beat the dinner rush. When we pulled up to the parking lot, it was already entirely full. Really? Who eats at 5 PM?! I guess everyone else had the same exact thought, too. She dropped me off to get on the wait list and proceeded to stalk a family walking to their car. The hostess quoted a reasonable 30-45 minute wait time. They provide sodas, popcorn, and chips+salsa in their large waiting area with seating. I wonder why they don't convert this into more dining space. Anyway, we waited closer to an hour, but the time flew by because we were so immersed in girl talk. By the time we were seated, the average wait time jumped to 90 minutes. Clearly we had to get the steak, but we knew that with our appetites, we'd never finish one on our own. We split a 16 oz ribeye, including one trip to the salad and bread bar. How strict are they on this one-trip rule? Because that was some damn good bread, especially paired with cinnamon butter. The salad bar had a variety of fresh options. I even got a few slices of watermelon for my bestie, since it's her fave. They only put in our steak order after we returned from the salad bar to time our courses appropriately. When the steak came out, they had cut it in half for us already, with whipped mashed potatoes as a side. Mine was perfectly pink and I drizzled garlic butter alllllll over it. This stuff is made of pure bliss and fat. My best friend's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare. She was disappointed but enjoyed the flavor regardless. I should mention that I only ate half my steak, being so full from the bread/salad, and was saving room for dessert. Our server brought out a huge tray with 10 different kinds of cakes/pies/tarts. What an effective selling tactic - shoving dessert in my face. I'LL TAKE ONE OF EVERYTHING, PLEASE. Just kidding; people around me would've been too judgmental. We got a snickers cheesecake to share, but had to take it to go because we were late for our movie. I'm happy to report that it was heavenly. We had mentioned to our server that we were in a rush to catch a movie, but she still wore her invisibility cloak and was no where to be found whenever we needed her.  Despite missing the first 5 minutes of Despicable Me 2, we enjoyed our meal. I would only return for special occasions though (complimentary dessert of your choice for birthdays!), because the parking, long wait time, and slow service are a bit of a hassle."
"We have been here couple of time. This places is pricey however it totally worthy. The staffs are treat you very professional. The food is fantastic. I love the steak here, you can ask to pick your own steak and have it cook what ever style you like. I also love the salad bar here, they have a variety of salad, cheese, and all kind of fruits. This restaurant is very busy on the weekend and the holiday but they have a very nice waiting area, you can order drink while you waiting and chat with your friends, other restaurant just dont have that. Dont forget to order the chocolate cake for the desert they have the best chocolate cake."
"Everyone should try the cowboy steak or tomahawk ribeye at least once. You'll probably have to share the tomahawk. If you're disappointed, you probably complain about everything and weren't spanked enough as a child.Here's a fun tip - get the mac n cheese, go the salad bar, scoop up some bacon & jalepenos, and then mix it. Yes, I have no shame.The salad bar is amazing. I'll admit, I've came for lunch and just ate the salad bar. It's really fresh! I like to get bacon, eggs, jalepenos, cheese, and bread. Then I make little breakfast sandwich bites. Again, I really have no shame. I'll admit that the eggs are a little, too cold, but sometimes you can't let the little things stop you from accomplishing big things.There's usually a decent wait time - don't worry though, there's free soda, popcorn, chips & salsa while you wait for dinner. Only free soda for lunchtime though."
This place was everything!!! I was a little apprehensive at first but I definitely have to say it's worth writing home to Mom about!   I would recommend the server Valentina. She's definitely knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful.
"Our first time here and we enjoyed it thoroughly! We reached TOT at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon, and were surprised that the lot wasn't packed, since the Yelp reviews warned about long wait times. Well, turns out that they don't open until 3:30 pm on Saturday's. No worries, though- the hostess was more than happy to take down our names and guide us to the waiting area in the back, which was filling up quickly. The waiting area itself had a bar, and complimentary snacks such as popcorn and soft drinks, which we decided to not partake in, knowing we were about to fill up on steak. As for the food... I had the 6 oz center cut fillet with garlic butter, since I'm into more tender and soft steaks. My friend had the cowboy steak, 24 oz with lemon pepper. Both steaks tasted great, but the cowboy was a bit more rubbery in some parts; however, it was still delicious. The salad bar was loaded with fresh veggies, dressings, and bread. The sides of mashed potatoes and steak fries were perfectly yummy compliments to our steak. The service was also impeccable, from the moment we entered with the hostess, to the guy who led us to our seats, to our wonderful server. He took the time to explain the menu to us since it was our first time, and was always available without hovering. Our cloth napkins were folded, silverware set properly, and old plates removed during our trips to the salad bar. Our beverage glasses were never left empty. We were shown the dessert platter, but were too stuffed- next time, however (yes, there will be a next time), I don't plan on leaving without dessert!"
"I came around 6:30PM with a party of 8 and luckily beat the dinner rush. Even though it was Tuesday, the place was pretty packed by 8PM. Of course, I had some popcorn and chips and salsa but I made sure not to fill up because I know what I had ahead of me.Service was great as usual. A person in our party new the GM, who stopped by to say hi, and he found that we were celebrating a birthday. We repeatedly told him we did not want anything free and just wanted to say hi. I split the cowboy with my fiancé and it was more than enough food for us. We had a hearty salad and a baked potato. The meat was cooked perfect and the marbling with garlic butter made the steak super juicy. I am a fan of their bone-in cuts because I feel they are more tender than the bone-out cuts.By the end of the meal, the party was stuffed. Then a couple of waiters stopped by and brought out 5 different desserts. Now, I know they usually give out a dessert for a birthday.. but FIVE?! The GM wanted to show his appreciation and let us try their best desserts. My favorite is still the snickers cheesecake. That thing is addicting. Another great experience for me and I will be returning soon."
"One of the best steakhouses I have ever been to!I know it sounds crazy, but their salad bar is worth going there for!  Everything is ultra fresh and many, many options.  If you are like me everything in the garden goes on with the lettuce...Don't forget quail bites!The service is excellent and the experience is wonderful!Pricey, but you ought to go at least once!"
Probably one of the better steakhouses I've ever been to...period. Great service. The staff is very attentive. Great atmosphere. You have the option to choose your own cut of steak. 100% angus certified beef. My server was on the ball for sure. Always checked in on me to make sure I was doing good. I travel a ton on business always looking for the local hot spots... This is certainly one of them. Clean restrooms. Well managed. Staff can handle traffic really well. They all have the earpieces to communicate. These folks don't fool around. Will highly recommend to my friends and business associates. EC
My wife and I enjoyed our anniversary here.The food was wonderful and the service was even better than that.Thank you staff and management for a wonderful evening!And thank you Rebekah for being such a great server!!!
"It's very huge simple texan steak house, very entertaining, if you have visitors out of the city. Steaks are just unbelievable I can't even put in words how tasteful it was. Salad bar was fresh and tasty dressings."
"I lived in the Houston area for most of my life and Taste of Texas is a staple. If you're a Texan and want a hunk of meat, along with some pretty killer sides and awesome service, look no further.I've been here as a kid, as a teenager, and as a young adult. I remember coming here as a fourth grader on a field trip and getting to sample their chicken strips. We also got to tour the huge freezer and get locked in there. I mean, it was pretty cool, like, literally.I was taken here on my 21st birthday by my parents and also came here twice with my boyfriend to celebrate anniversaries. Service is amazing each and every time. Depending on the day and time you come, your wait can be 2-3 hours. But, what's awesome, is that they have a ginormous room for those waiting and offer FREE chips and salsa along with water, tea, or soft drinks. So, if you come and don't care about a wait, it's no big deal. You can relax, grab a drink from the bar, and just hang out. Bartenders are always awesome and I was actually introduced to one of my favorite drinks here because it was recommended to me: the Bahama Mama. Yep, that drink is on point.I can't tell you much about the menu because when I find something I like, I usually stick with it. I always get the center cut filet, normally 6 oz ($37) or if I'm super hungry, the 10 oz ($45). With this, you also get a trip to the salad bar which has tons of options. And you can pile that salad as high as you like! I love the variety they offer at the salad bar. You can also grab cornbread or bread with butter or their cinnamon buttery blend that is fantastic. I used to order my steak medium, but have switched to medium rare in the recent years. So much tastier. Every time I have ever been here, the steaks have always been cooked perfectly. One time, however, my steak was extremely overcooked. I ordered medium rare and definitely got medium well. It kind of stunk that everyone else ate while I had to wait another 15 minutes for a steak, but what are you going to do. I had the server apologize numerous times (and I know it wasn't his fault and didn't say it was at all) which was very nice. I also had the floor manager that night come to the table and he apologized as well and made sure the second steak was perfect. It definitely was and I thanked him. I'm really not the type of person to complain and it was certainly hard for me to send a steak back. But, for the price you pay, you should get exactly what you want. I was disappointed in the fact that we weren't comped in any way. I wasn't expecting a free steak, but a little money off would have been appreciated. Then again, I'm not sure how they'd do if everyone who sent a steak back got some type of compensation. I have tried numerous desserts: creme brulee, snickers pie, slice of heaven, the Texas pecan pie a la mode, and the apple dumplings. I know my boy liked the Creme Brulee and the Snickers Pie especially. The Slice of Heaven is a mix of layered white and dark chocolate mousse. It's very yummy, I just don't particularly like white chocolate, so I make sure someone else eats that part. The Pecan Pie and Apple Dumplings are definitely my favorite desserts though. Get those and you won't be disappointed!"
"Arrived around 6pm tonight, Thursday, and our table of four was sat within 30 mins. The decor is kind of all over the place with moose heads to baseball jerseys on the walls. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole service. I was the only one in our group who hadn't eaten there before so they all came to the back with me to pick out my center cut filet. Stopped by the salad bar on our way back to the table. Decent variety of items to choose from. I liked how there was an employee there to immediately tidy up any fallen pieces of lettuce or dripped dressing to keep the area clean. Our quail bites and jalapeño stuffed shrimp apps were on the table before we got back. I preferred the quail over the shrimp. Tried not to eat a whole roll even though the cinnamon butter was addicting. My steak was cooked to perfection. Really tender and no needed sauce to mask the flavor. The sides (garlic mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, mushrooms) were ok but nothing great. We ordered the dessert sampler where you can choose 3 out of 4 select options. I liked how each dessert wasn't overly sweet. Overall, Taste of Texas is a casual quirky steakhouse with good steak and good service."
"What is the big deal about this place? My boyfriend and I have been trying out a lot of new restaurants that have been on our list for months. And to our disappointment, a lot of them have been so-so.We came on a Monday night and they looked packed. Luckily there was no wait (FYI they don't take reservations). Both of us felt just a tiny bit underdressed even though we've heard that this was a ""steakhouse where you don't have to get all dressed up for."" I got the 16 oz NY strip and he got a 20 oz ribeye - both cooked medium rare plus. We both got our garlic butter on the side along with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. The steaks were cooked to perfection; the temperature was great. It wasn't too bloody or too tough. We were both very pleased. However, everything needed more salt. The steak was very bland. I practically salted every single bite. I even tried garlic butter and salt. The green beans were overcooked, a bit mushy, and unsalted. The mashed potatoes were decent, but unsalted. We both spent so much time with the cute little salt shaker on the table. By the way, where are they from? We want a set!The salad bar was good, but I thought it would have more variety. I really liked the warm rolls and cilantro vinaigrette. But come on, I'm here for the steak... not the other stuff."
"Wow. This place is usually our go to. Unfortunately I brought a friend who had never been for dinner last Monday night May 1st. I was excited to show him one of our favorite spots in town. Most of the experience was positive until it came to our steak. Although we ordered it with garlic butter, it came out bare and not on a hot plate as requested. We had to be the ones to remind the waitress. She immediately recognized the fault and later a floor manager came over to apologize. However nothing was offered to make up for the mistake other than to go get a hot plate after we already started eating. We had to smother cold butter on the steak which made it that much more unenjoyable. I could call out the waitress and a manager by name but choose not to and hope the restaurant will take action accordingly to make sure this experience doesn't happen to others. When you're asking people to spend over $50 for a steak alone that should be better than this.  I know the ownership feels the same way which is why we have had such good experiences in the past."
"Extraordinary service!  My husband and I used to eat here at least once a week.  We celebrated my birthday last month and it's good to know that all the floor managers still remembers you and stops by to say hi.  I love the ambiance and how laid back it is.  It's the one place I feel comfortable and at home. Menu items I recommend:  bone in filet, crab cakes, prime rib, and I always get their star cookies and cinnamon ice cream!"
"GREAT STEAKS.  Prime rib succulent, impressive salad bar, great meal."
"Arrived during dinner time on a busy holiday weekend. Wait time was practically 2-3 minutes. We were whisked away to our table, and there on the table sat some crackers with jalapeno jelly and cream cheese. Odd pairing, but the flavors mesh really well. The ambiance is quite nice, dark/earthy colors, dimly lit. There was chatter but it wasn't overly loud. Dress is casual, so this is a perfect spot for a date or family outing. Our waiter was very attentive, so thumbs up for that.Now onto the food - I opted for the salad bar which had FRESH greens. That's always something I look for. There are 2 huge blocks of cheese to pick from and you can grate enough cheese to your heart's content. And the bread selection was really good. Jalapeno corn bread? Yes, please! It's really easy to stuff yourself with just the salad bar/bread alone.I opted for the Filet Mignon as my main dish. It came out HOT with garlic butter melting off the top. First bite melted in my mouth, as was the case until the very last bite. Very delicious. As someone visiting out of town, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'd highly recommend this place if you're in the area and craving steak!"
"They have great prime rib, great strip, and amazing ribeye! I'm a steak guy and love it here. When it's busy I try and sneak in at the bar. Management and service is always good. It is a little pricey but if you want good service, good drinks, and even better beef you have to pay up for the best!"
"As we were waiting for our table, we saw an extremely tall man walking towards the exit and it was Yao Ming!  We knew we were in for a treat if Yao Ming was dining here too.Everything was great from the start.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgable and led us to the back to pick out our steaks.  We did not know much about how to pick steaks but he coached us through it and made sure we chose for our liking (more fat, more taste, etc.)Ordering a steak includes the salad bar which was very fresh and good.  Try not to eat too much salad though and save room for the steak.  We ordered a cowboy steak and center cut filet mignon both medium rare and prepared with lemon pepper and garlic herb butter seasoning as recommended.  Both steaks were extremely flavorful, tender and cooked just to our liking (med rare).  The prices were extrememly reasonable for a high quality steakhouse.For dessert we had a snickers cheesecake and an alcoholic milkshake which were both on point, but we were struggling to find space for the dessert.I would definitely come back to Taste of Texas."
"Best steak in houston. A must go to. Anything you order here is delicious! You can pick your steak from the butcher before it's cooked and the stuffed shrimp is great for an appetizer or a meals you can't go wrong with anything- if there is a wait when you go. Stay. Have a drink in the bar, read the history around the restaurant and enjoy complimentary snacks and sodas"
"Highly reccomend this top notch restaurant!!! When we arrived we wondered why there was a bar with beverages and stuff outside by a beautiful waterfalls and plenty of seatng but not tables. When we left we got it! It was there to make people comfortable while waiting to get a table. Inside the restaurant is beautifully finished. When you wait they offer FREE soda beverages, chips and salsa and popcorn. We where immediately impressed with the professional, friendly, knowledgeabl staff! Now, lets talk about the real star!! The menue! Many choices including not your hum drum salad bar! You cant go wrong with ANYTHING on the menue. I can say my husband and I travel and eat out extensively. The steaks were THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!! SO GO ENJOY AND REMBER TO SAFE ROOM FOR THEIR AMAZUNG DESERTS!!! EPIC FOOD EXPERIENCE! :)"
EVERYTHING IS BIGGER AND BETTER IN TEXAS! Taste of Texas is absolutely the best piece of cow you will ever get! Everything from the salad bar to the quail bites to the steak is top notch quality. Restaurant is beautiful and pretty with two full bars. Service is excellent from hostess to wait staff. Manager walked around and asked every table how the food was. Taste of Texas is pretty pricey but well worth it. It was my birthday and I got free dessert which looked amazing too. They took a picture of me and my girlfriend and printed it off for us too. Overall you can't go wrong with this place.
wowzers!!! that was some good eating!!! and our waiter was THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!
"I don't get the hype. Yes it's a steakhouse. Yes it has a dated Texas-y decor. Omg, a salad bar? How exciting!  Service was mediocre at best. The political signs in the grass out front were a bit of a turn off. I've got some money left on the gift card, but probably won't be back to spend it."
"My first review here but my second time at this place. I always have my steak WELL-DONE and no others steak house had cooked it right the first time except for Taste of Texas. The waiter/waitress would makes recommendation for the meat that's most suitable to your taste/cook 'rare, medium, well-done, etc.' This time I ordered the Tomahawk which is 38 ounces with a really big bone. As always well-done and you'll get to go pick your own meat. I love the salad bar and their rolls...different varieties...but don't eat too much save your stomach for your delicious mouth watering steak. With a well-done steak this is the only place that cook them moist, topped with their house flavor 'recommended', and very juicy/tender. The price is pricey but for a good steak I would not mind pay that extra $$$ for it. Check them out!!! My tomahawk steak is a little burned outside since it's well-done but very tender and moist... I'm definitely coming back in the near future"
"I went with my wife twice in the last month. This latest time we were told there would be a 1.5-2 hour wait and this was at 5:30 PM. We went to the inside bar and stood, ordering drinks. The bartender asked if we would like to eat at the bar, which we had done many times previously. When we said yes, he reserved the next 2 open spots at the bar. We were ordering within minutes instead of the long wait. The crab cake was incredible with so much crab, I am surprised it held together. The porterhouse never fails to awe me with its taste, My wife had an 18 OZ rib-eye that was fork tender. Both steaks were cooked exactly as we like them.My wife asks to come here just for the salad bar with the blocks of cheese, and super rolls.I know this place is expensive and crowded, but it is worth saving up to go. I will keep returning until they close it, which I doubt will be for decades"
"Been here once with my boyfriend,last year on our 1year anniversary, AMAZING! Cant wait to go back and eat their yummy steak and salmon (which we had) and also fell in love with their salad bar lol.Awesome service!"
"Dined here last night with my father for his birthday, the wait staff was awesome.. The drinks are way too expensive, the parking was horrible.. The food was mediocre at best.. I ordered the pecan crusted chicken, it was tasty yet dry.. I enjoyed the baked Bree as an appetizer.. My dad loved the grilled salmon, and the steak that my aunt had was flavorful but dry.."
Man one of my favorite restaurants been coming here for years same great service great food and the salad bar thats the best part with the rolls and the blue cheese dressing man best place to go great atmosphere
"My wife and I have eaten here a couple of times for special occasions. In both cases the food was really good. The steak was cooked just as we ordered and the potatoes were tasty. We both loved the salad bar and I have to say that I'd come back more for the salad bar than the steak. Service was ok although not very attentive. The BIG negative that gives the place a 3 star review is that they don't take reservations and the wait can be brutal. They have a large waiting room and put out free drinks, chips, popcorn etc. but we waited well over an hour each time we went. Some families brought cards or board games to make the wait more tolerable.May go back at some point because the food is good but the wait for a table makes me hesitate."
"I had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what I was getting into when I came here.  I thought it was a simple steak/bbq joint.  But boy was I wrong.  Taste of Texas takes tremendous pride in their meats, and in their salad bar, and in their desserts, and in everything else they do.  They made a near flawless attempt and satiating this lover of fine steak, salad, and dessert.But alas, they tripped right after the start.  The complimentary bread and butter was a pretty good start, but the french dip sliders were not.  The bread was weird.  And it took away from the French dippiness of the sliders.  Anyway, I got the quail bites to help rectify that mishap, and was not disappointed.  The quail bites are the shiznit.  They're delicious.  I'll be making them at home now.  They're wrapped in bacon and stuffed with jalapenos.  And they come with (yes, this APPETIZER comes with sides) jalapeno poppers.  And the Dr. Pepper bbq dipping sauce... just wow.  Amazing stuff.So, after the appetizer rebound, I ordered a 10 oz prime rib.  It was definitely rare, which I'm ok with (would prefer med-rare).  And it came with green beans and the salad bar.  OH MY THE SALAD BAR.  Really the salad bar is nothing crazy.  Typical salad bar.   OH WAIT GIANT HUNKS OF CHEESE!!!  On the salad bar are two blocks of cheese, each literally the size of a small child.  And freshly baked bread - cornbread and dinner rolls - with different types of butter.  Yes, this is all the ""salad"" bar.I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT DESSERT! So, after your meal, your server doesn't ask if you would like dessert.  They just bring a giant sampler tray for you to gawk at until you finally give in and order something.  They explain each item, saving the best items for last.  And you inevitably forget how stuffed your are.  And thus, I ordered the largest piece of pecan pie I've ever seen.  It was at least 4 times as deep as a normal pie.  But it was just as delicious.I will come back next time I'm in town."
"Went Here For My Bday. Was very pricey but it was delish and loved the service before we got to our tables ; refreshments,  popcorn ect. I would go back for more big occasion nights."
"Normally, when my family and I celebrate birthdays, we head to Pappadeaux (the one next to Taste of Texas) since it's the best one in the whole state. However, we decided to go a different route this time to change it up. After checking reviews, we decided on Taste of Texas. They don't accept reservations so we arrived early enough for a shorter wait. Welp! So much for that since the wait was an hour pretty soon after they opened for dinner and it was totally worth it! They have free sodas and water while you wait which was nice since it was so hot outside. The manager came out and chatted for a while to keep us comfortable and walked around to others waiting as well. How awesome is that?! Once inside the restaurant, our waiter (will add his name as soon as I remember) was simply wonderful! Very pleasant and patient for a table of 13. He was funny, organized and just great! The food is awesome! They give you so much that the entire table had a box to take home. The manager came around again to make sure we enjoyed our food and gave us the history of the restaurant and other tid bits.  My mom said that this was the best birthday that she's had in a while. She loved having her complete family there but the restaurant made her day for some reason. Lol! We will be returning quite often now. I highly recommend this place!"
"Great steak, I got the cowboy and my wife the filet oscar. 3 hour wait sucked, but it is NYE."
"Awesome place!!! I ordered the Tomahawk and they allowed me to go back to the kitchen and select the steak I wanted, which made the experience more enjoyable! The food was delicious , the service was great and don't forget to order dessert ..."
"My husband and I went to Taste of Texas last night to celebrate our one year anniversary. My family has gone here a number of times to celebrate events over the years so it seemed like a great choice as he had never been. Dessert was delicious- Jackie (I believe) did a great job of showing us the options. The Snickers pie was a wonderful way to end our meal. The entrees were perfect. My center cut filet Oscar style was perfectly medium rare and melt in your mouth. I rarely want steak but this was perfection. The garlic mashed potatoes had the perfect amount of flavor and were perfectly creamy. My husband loved his rare prime rib and sweet potato. He didn't say much about it but kept smiling as he was chewing- which I definitely don't see while he eats my cooking. The appetizer- the jumbo lump crab cake- was amazing. Our server, Mark M. (who was also exceptional), recommended this and boy was he right. It was hot, melt in your mouth crab perfection. No fillers, only crab meat held together with cheese. I've been here before and my mother loves to brag about the amazing service and attention to detail here. Now why three stars? The first hostess we saw upon arrival helped us quickly. Our number came up within minutes.  We were lead to our table and upon seeing I would be behind a screaming child, I asked that we be moved to another table. We told her we had no problem waiting for another table to be available. She sighed and said they could move us. The third hostess (who I assume was handling seating) rolled her eyes when she heard we would like another seat and was quite rude about handling our ticket. I would have much rather been asked to wait than to watch the hostesses treat us like a chore. I'm so sorry to have inconvenienced them because I would like a nice dining experience.I read other reviews and saw managers apparently come by and check on the tables. If the gentleman in the suit walking around our table was the manager, he never spoke to us and looked at us like we were eating with our hands. (Relax we weren't- oddly we were some of the few people who were dressed up beyond t-shirts and jeans.) The waitstaff is great- they are caring and knowledgeable. They will guide you through the menu and give great recommendations. The food is amazing. The hostesses and manager (in our section) could use a refresher. I had emailed Taste of Texas earlier today with no response. Not sure we will be returning."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town and I've been coming here for 20 years. I always bring visitors - and last night was the worst ToT experience I've had there. The waiter (not waitress) Kelly was the worst I've met. He:a) Didn't bother to ask whether it was our first time - so after we ordered, I reminded him. Didn't do anything.b) Made us wait for him at the salad bar before choosing our steaks because he had to go do something.c) Didn't come and ask whether we wanted pepper on our salads. d) Had our steaks brought out - by another waiter no less, who, by the way, literally didn't say a single word. Very awkward - WHILE we were still working on our salads. I'd understand if this is because we had been chomping on salads for half an hour but it was within 15 mins of us sitting down with our salads. e) 20 mins later, and that's being generous, he asked my friend who was pausing whether she was done with her steak. She had eaten half of it. AND, her bf had ordered a porterhouse and had a LONG way to go and I was also working on my fillet. She of course said No. f) As soon as I put down my fork after my last bite, he cleared my plate, but it had an asparagus on it. As he left the table, my friend commented how she had wanted it but he swooped in like a hawk. Overall, I felt rushed on multiple occasions. Then he had the gall to ask whether everything was perfect. We of course said yes - I was treating visitors from out of town, and they were being treated, so what would we say? I then reminded him about them being first time visitors and directly asked for pictures - he said he was sorry he forgot to tell me that that's only for international visitors. That's a load of bull because I brought two visitors from NY and CT within the last couple of months and they all took pictures with the cowboy hats. Kelly took pics but didn't even bother to bring the cowboy hats. I wasn't going to ask the third time so I stayed quiet. Then the bill came. I had gift cards from my cousin so I used that, and he asked me how much tip I was going to put on it. I was dumbfounded that he asked me that so loudly in front of my guests. I was not happy with him and would've done a flat 15% but because he asked in front of my guests, I said 20%. Don't get me wrong. The steak is great. I've had off nights before where the steak isn't the best but last night's was great. It's just that I'm never sitting at Kelly's table ever again. I think there actually is a Kelly that's a woman and if that's the name I'm thinking, she is awesome. But the guy Kelly, never again."
"Have very happily and eagerly spent thousands of dollars over the past twenty years or so at ToT, both at company Christmas luncheons and personally for various family/friend celebrations and events, so it truly distressed me to discover that Edd and Nina have decided to post 30.07 signage that leaves me no alternative but to spend my and my company's money elsewhere. Apparently, in this instance, when it came time to walk the walk, the Hendee's weren't quite able to step up to the plate, which is such a shame."
"It's easy to forget that you're at a restaurant here with the friendly staff and such a strong feeling of hospitality.  The salad bar is amazing and so are the steaks.  Not much to say negatively on the menu.  Love the cozy, non rushed feel here.  Plan to come early since they don't take reservations, but totally a classic Texan restaurant."
"Expensive, average service. We have been here over 5 times and the last three years with guests and experienced things getting progressively worse in terms of food and service. Last night we had to send our overlooked steaks back and therefore our party ate their meal at three different times while the sides got cold. It was our last time at this Houston icon. Sad....."
"This is the perfect place to bring Yankee friends and family who want to see what Texas food is all about but are too prissy to get their hands dirty with some local BBQ. The salad bar and bread is phenomenal. My mouthwateringly perfect salad contains fresh spring mix, a sprinkle of parm, slivers of red onion, toasted cinnamon almonds and real bacon bits all smothered in sweet and tangy cilantro vinaigrette. I never thought I'd be so over the moon about a salad, but this will be a salad I crave. The cheesy bread and the jalepeno cornbread are to die for. Make sure you grab extra to take home in your to-go box! And don't forget the cinnamon butter! Yes, cinnamon butter with jalepeno cornbread. DO IT. True to the phrase 'everything is bigger in Texas,' portions are very large here. For my entree I had the pecan crusted chicken breast. This was VERY tasty, and stuffed with what tasted like spinach dip. It was moist and tender but crunchy on the outside. The green beans it was served with were buttery and bacon-y. The wild rice was also good, but just couldn't compete with buttery beans and tender chicken on the plate with it. I got 2 large meals out of this entree.I tried my friend's steak medallions and those were even better than my chicken. Whatever sauce they serve on that plate is magical. My husband ordered the Au Jous sliders and those were also quite good and easily 2 meals.This place could easily be a 5-star joint, but the fact that there is no cheaper lunch menu is quite annoying to me. It definitely didn't seem like they skimped on service or food size or quality at lunch, but nonetheless, a menu of smaller less expensive lunch plates would be nice. If not a full lunch menu, how about weekdays with special promos?"
flew through texas and got a recommendation to eat here. one of my best decision in life! the steak is to die for and the salad bar is amazing. the rolls are good too. love the fact you get to pick out the steak by weight. worth every penny. been recommending this place since my first visit.
"Got here just before rush hour on a Friday night so we didn't have to wait for a table. The service was good. The place is not fancy. The price is fair. Appetizer - Husband and I both got the salad bar and split the quail with stuffed jalapeño as appetizer. The quail was good. I'm not impressed with the salad bar. Steak - we split the tomahawk. We tried to finish it. We couldn't. Nothing special about the steak, really. It was properly cooked, not tough, taste is just ok.Sides - potato gratin and crab cakes. I love their crab cakes! It's full of lump crab meat! One of the best I've had. Gratin is just ok."
"Taste of Texas used to be my favorite place to take guests out for a nice steak dinner.  The steaks are very good.  The salad bar is good.  The service is usually outstanding.  But my last visit was below par and I'm going to air my grievances.Before I go into the unique experiences, let me point out for everyone that there are a couple standing issues with Taste of Texas.  They do not offer valet parking and they do not accept reservations.  That means wait times of two hours are common.  Now - to my recent experience at Taste of Texas ....I brought guests.  One of them made the very bad choice to order a well-done prime rib.  If you like well done meat, don't order prime rib.  I did not hear him order this, or I would have guided him to order something else.   Complaint #1:  I would expect a waiter to make an alternate recommendation to anyone who orders like this.  I know the waiter did not offer a suggestion or this man would have accepted the recommendation. Complaint #2:  When the waiter brought the steak out, he placed it and said in a very condescending and unapproving tone, ""Here's your WELL DONE prime rib, sir"".   I heard this and wanted to jump up and and yell at the waiter for his extremely rude tone.  This upset me so much I was angry for weeks to follow.   But I chose to not say anything to allow our dinner to remain as pleasant as possible.   I wish I had this guys name though.Complaint #3:  Everyone seemed to feel that their meal was not as good as it used to be.  We've all been to Taste of Texas before many times.  But the steaks just seemed a little more ordinary.  Maybe the quality is different, maybe the seasoning was a little different.  But it was just not quite what we remembered.  It was a shared feeling.Complaint #4:  The prices seems much higher than we recalled.  I know it is not cheat to eat there and that's okay.  It just seemed to be more expensive.  After the entire dinner is done and we've left, I just felt like this was the last time I would go to Taste of Texas.  There are more expensive places and there are less expensive places.  The goal is to find a match between service, quality, and price.  Taste of Texas is moving down on the scale for experience versus cost."
"I've been going here 15 years. They are consistently on top of everything - their food and especially service is one of the best in Houston. This is the first restaurant I take out-of-town guests to so that should say something. All first timers are treated to an open tour along with a very brief history of the restaurant and a quick trip to the butcher shop to pick and claim your own piece of steak. Everyone has their own preference in terms of what cut they like but I will say the filet mignon is out of this world. If red meat is not your thing, they have a very good, high quality salad bar that can be paired with a delicious potato soup or chicken breast. Their dinner rolls are highly addicting and out of this world. For dessert, you absolutely MUST try their pecan pie. During weekends and busy hours, there may be a 10-25 minute wait but they have that covered as well. There is a fairly nice sized waiting area with its own bar, tables, complimentary chips, popcorn and drinks."
"I came here on my birthday while I was traveling on vacation and this place was recommended by a friend. We knew this place was going to be busy because they do not take reservations. We arrived at 7pm on a weekday and immediately noticed how busy the parking lot was. After parking, we walked inside and was greeted by the hostess and they assigned us a number. We were 86 and they were currently calling numbers in the 50s. The waiting area is extremely nice and big. The wait wasn't too bad as we were called in about 30 minutes. The restaurant is nice and upscale and I was a bit under dressed compared to the majority of the people there. Now, for appetizers, we started with the Jumbo Crab Cakes and they were amazing. For my entree, I went with the Porterhouse Steak, which is 32oz! I shared this with 4 people and we were still full from it. The steak was cooked perfectly to our style and it was really good. The steak also comes with access to the salad bar for 2 people. My gf went there and brought back bread and salad. The salad bar is probably one of the nicer ones because they offer so much stuff. I also tried the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and this was okay for the most part. Definitely enjoyed this place and it definitely compares to some of the more expensive Steakhouse that I have eaten at in the past."
"Oh my gosh, this place is SO tacky! They serve the steaks on silver cow shaped plates. I'm positive the same style of plates are used at this Vietnamese steak and eggs place in china town. My steak was smothered in butter. Okay, by now, everyone must know that a top quality steak shouldn't be covered in butter, right?Not impressed! And all of the desserts were boring! The wait was excruciatingly long which defeats the entire purpose of a reservation."
I was visiting from ga and my aunt and uncle took me with my 6 year old! Delish! Perfectly cooked strip with lemon pepper seasoning. For appetizer we got the baked brie. Can you say yum? We got to go to salad bar and they have a great selection with a giant cheese block and a fresh bread. The waiter was so knowledgeable on wine pairings and really catered to my 6 year old. The whole experience was great and I have zero complaints. We went early because apparently if you go Sunday at 6 u will wait over an hour. For dessert we split the key lime pie. Great crust and very fresh. The filling was very good and you can tell it was not a frozen pre maid pie. Very pricey but worth it if you want a good steak.
"This place is more than famous in Houston. When you look for high end Steak in Houston, this is a must go place. Food, server, environment is all 5 star, just be patient to wait one hour or more since they do not accept reservations."
Oh wow. This place is the real deal. They are not afraid to cook a steak medium rare and let me tell you.... It was perfect. The cowboy rib eye is to die for and the rib eye by the ounce is amazing. Make sure that you get the cilantro vineagerette on your salad. Awesome.
"I absolutely love ToT! Besides the wait (expect up to 2 hours) depending on what time you come especially on the weekends. You have to time it right and just make dinner plans before 530pm on the weekends to avoid the long wait. They don't take reservations but they do offer peanuts, popcorn and free soft drinks in the waiting area. The staff is very professional, serving and nice. I've never encountered a grouchy waiter or staff at ToT. My boyfriend and I usually get the burger and salad bar as a meal and we always leave very satisfied and full. I've had the pecan crusted chicken, baked sweet potato, rib eye steak , baked potato soup, artichoke dip, baked Brie and all have not disappointed my taste buds. We love the breads especially the cheese bread. But we try not to stuff ourselves with that. The desserts we always stick to is the snickers pie. We absolutely love that its rich in chocolate and sweet. I've tried the Creme brûlée before as well and it was delicious."
"Recently, to celebrate Father's Day and my birthday, I had the pleasure of attending two special events at Taste of Texas. Their Steak and Texas Beer night was outstanding. The food was amazing and the variety of St. Arnold's beer was great. It was a very fun, enjoyable, entertaining, and informative evening hosted by the restaurant owners and the St. Arnold's representative. Next, I went to Steak School. Again, a very enjoyable and informative morning hosted by the owners, executive chef, and representatives from their beef suppliers. After a morning of information to explain everything from ""hoof to table"", we enjoyed a very tasty steak lunch. These events - besides promoting their fabulous food and restaurant - also help benefit their scholarship fund for their workers. The owners are very community minded, family oriented, and their Christian values are evident. Great restaurant, great food, great atmosphere, great special events!"
"We live in CA and we have family and a second home in TX.  This is their favorite steak house.  I will say that the meat is great, it is cooked perfectly and the prices are reasonable.  I also get a kick out of the fact that I can select my own cut in the back.The salad bar is terrific, but as someone else mentioned, the sides are just OK.  My kids love the fact that they can get free soda while you wait."
First of all they get really busy towards the evening! But their steak is amazing!!!! I am always bringing friends to come dine with me. Servers are always so nice. And their salad bar and bread is always good.But their steak I usually order the cowboy steak.It's always cooked perfectly.
"THE BEST ANGUS MEAT IN THE HOLE TEXAS... 100% certified... It's really expensive but it's all worth it. You also have a great selection of wines, and a big salad bar."
"Every time I walk into this restaurant, I hear the theme of Bonanza playing in my head. Why? Well, between the rustic Texas charm of this place and the lodge décor, it makes me feel like I'm stepping back in time a bit to the old West where men wore cowboy hats and rode around on horses slinging their guns. The décor may feel rustic, but the service and food are far from feeling this way.The only complaint I have about this amazing neighborhood steak restaurant is that they don't take reservations. If you can get past the 2 hour wait, you will enjoy your meal and the service that comes along with it. The lines are long and the parking is tough if you opt to dine here during the busy dinner times on the weekends. Early dinner and lunch time are much easier if you want to be seated immediately and find decent parking.If you decide to dine here during the peak times, you at least have an option of having free popcorn, soda, water, chips & salsa, which are all provided in the waiting area. The downside of this is that you may fill yourself with snacks and then have no room for your steak dinner. The other option is to use my tactic of putting your name on the waitlist and then running home to shower and get ready or run errands; by the time you return, you should be close to being seated.Once seated, you are treated to a big open space full of wood tables, wood chairs, dark carpets, and more than enough wood walls and ceilings adorned with all things lodge looking. The best time to visit here is during the Christmas season when they deck the halls, the walls, and anything else that they can throw decorations on.Once seated, you will be greeted by one of dozens of friendly faces that are more than willing to help or assist in anything and everything in the restaurant. The server will start you off with bringing a complimentary appetizer of cream cheese smothered in salsa and accompanied by toasted bread. Next up, they will thoroughly cover the drink and dining menus to help navigate the potential maze of decisions. The question is not which steak is the best, but which cut you like...you can't go wrong with any cut you get here.I order a different cut each time: filet, prime rib, rib eye, bone-in rib eye, T-bone, and they are all very good. The restaurant even gives you an option to select your own steak in their designated meat display in the kitchen. Once you've selected your steak, the salad bar awaits your presence. Chilled plates, a beautiful selection of salad veggies, cheeses, and dressings are all lined up for you to indulge. If that isn't enough, they have bread warming lockers to keep the bread warm, in addition to a choice of regular or cinnamon butter. Everything is self-service, so feel free to eat as much or as little as you would like.My advice is to try either their cilantro vinaigrette or their creamy cactus salad dressings because these are house specialties. All the dressings are made in-house, so don't feel bad if you want to go with the standard ranch or Italian. If you haven't stuffed yourself on the all-you-can-eat salad bar and bread, your steak will be arriving to ensure that your stomach is more than full.If all this food hasn't filled your stomach, then you'll have more than enough room to devour one of their Texas sized desserts that will be sure to send you into a diabetic coma. What? You mean you don't have a stomach the size of an NFL linebacker? Don't worry, because you can take all your leftovers home that they are always happy to pack up for you, including that dessert that you didn't even have room to finish.Happy trails to you!"
Amazing! Our first time here and it was wonderful ! The food is awesome! Brussel sprouts have made a come back! Complimentary cinnamon coffee with my cream brûlée delish this place puts  the sparkle in the holidays with the whole restaurant decked out for the holidays.  I believe this will be a new Christmas tradition.
The best steak house in Houston! They live up to the name!  Cooked to perfection. I've never had to send a steak back. The waiters are friendly. The salad bar is awesome!
"Great steaks! Love the salad bar! Seating was a breeze  and service was excellent. Steaks are huge and tru to size. You have the option to choose your own steak from the butcher after you've ordered it and they are cooked exactly how you want. The setting is nice and low lit. Great for couples or adults only, i really wouldn't bring young children here."
Being my first time here I was impressed with the service and quality of food. I do wish we could  have made a reservation but they don't accept then so plan on waiting about 45 minutes depending on the crowd.
"Who am I kidding?   This place is great!   I previously left a bad comment, but that's only because their seating policy used to be an issue, but things seem to have gotten better!"
The finest steakhouse in Houston. Can't wait to visit again when I'm back from North Carolina   Wait staff are so attentive and prime rib is out of this world.
One of our favorite steakhouses. I recommend the tomahawk ribeye. Excellent cut of meat and it always draws the attention of those sitting around you. We also like how they take care of the patrons waiting for a seat. Nothing better than some complementary popcorn and a soda while you wait.
Great ambiance and tasty steak. I would suggest going as a family dinner or business lunch.
"Came here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriends. Hands down the best steak I've had in ages. We were seated really quickly even though we didn't make any reservations, so that was a nice surprise. Our server was very knowledgeable and quite amusing. He knew a lot about the wines, the meat, and menu knowledge. He even let us head to the back to choose our own steaks, which was a really neat experience. My boyfriend has the cowboy steak, and I had an 8 oz. filter mignon. Both were delicious. The filter was very soft and tender, and the cowboy was big and juicy. Very heartful meal. As side items I got the mushrooms, which were very tasteful! Taste of Texas has a full buffet style salad bar that is very fresh. I am not a fan of salads... So my server was kind enough to realize that we weren't taking trips to the salad bar and offered us an extra side option. Very nice of him to do, so we had a little too much food on the table (it was awesome). After finishing our meals we got a complimentary dessert for my birthday. I decided to choose the cheesecake. It was so fluffly and delectable. I love taste of Texas & whenever we have a craving for steaks, I'll definitely come back to have a taste of probably the best steaks in Texas. My experience here with the food, the service, and the atmosphere was phenomal. Also a thanks for the friendly staff members and managers whom constantly are checking on the guests. Being in the restaurant industry and understanding it, means a lot to me and my boyfriend when it comes to service."
"The best steak in my opinion.  Service is excellent, nice atmosphere.  Love the chilled salad plate.  Everything is good.  While you are waiting for your seat you can nachos or popcorn."
"My wife and I enjoyed our one year anniversary here on Friday night. We arrived around 6:45 and had to wait 1 hr and 35 minutes for a table. Once again, this place reminded me of why we waited that long. The salad bar was amazing as always. The macaroni was also surprisingly delicious. The Tomahawk Ribeye was a little too thick for our preference and was slightly undercooked. Understandable given how thick a cut it is. Still very tasty.Our server was Jonathon, He took GREAT care of us and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy."
"Mmm. The steaks here are just wonderful, flavorful tenderness. It's worth the super-expensive price of coming here. Most, if not all, entrees come with a trip to the salad buffet which has so many toppings to try out! You can also get your bread there too. I love the jalapeno cheddar cornbread.The whole restaurant, inside and out, is just beautiful. Pretty enough for groups to take pictures and such. Lol. You can tell the servers here are very knowledgeable about their menu. Ask them anything, they're really helpful and nice! At least, the ones I've seen are.  Make sure you save room for one of their decadent desserts too. I recommend the creme brulee or the snickers pie. Or if you're feeling more on the healthy side, go for the fresh berries in season. Yumm-o!Not much to say about this place except try it out at least once in your life. It's a great place for dates, special occasions, etc. but I wouldn't be able to afford to eat here often."
My dad and I come here a lot for lunch! We're both foodies by nature. We absolutely love the salad bar. Always a great atmosphere and great service
All of these other reviews are telling you what Taste of Texas IS. I will now commence in telling you what Taste of Texas IS NOT.It IS NOT for the faint of heart.It IS NOT for vegetarians.It IS NOT going to be a cheap meal.It IS NOT a restaurant with poor wait service.It IS NOT a place you go to tune out your date.It IS NOT going to leave you hungry.It IS NOT going to disappoint you.Why are you still reading this? If you have $110 to blow on a date then drive to Taste of Texas immediately.
"WORST STEAK EVER. I selected the 16 oz sirloin, medium. The steak initially came out rare, when they returned the steak the second time it was well done. They then returned the steak a third time and it was still displeasing. The steak not only was not cooked properly, it was also the toughest steak I have ever eaten. My mother had to send her steak back as well. The server was very pleasant, but the manager only came to speak to us once and did not bother to follow up with us. I am extremely disappointed. I would definitely NOT recommend this place. Flemings is also in City Centre and awesome!"
"This place is an amazing find. The line is unbearable, but is well worth the wait.The great thing about this place, is while you wait there are free drinks (non-alcoholic) and servers come around with free appetizer bites every 20 or 30 minutes.Well worth the wait though, as you walk inside it reminded me of an old school elk lodge or something, with low lightning and lots of wood accents. Service is excellent here, and I like that a manager tries to stop by every table before they leave. But really, lets talk about the food.The prime rib is delicious to the max, Perfectly cooked, and humongous, with a great side of garlic (super garlic) mashed potatoes, au jou and horseradish sauce. It was melt in your mouth, beefy and delicious. That, and a well made self serve salad bar with many options, fresh ingredients, and build your own bread baskets with amazing cornbread seals the deal. The cheesecake is a solid ending to the meal, and yes, I'm coming back first chance I get."
"I was here last night for a business dinner. The food and service are top notch!  Our Server, Mandy, was amazing -great at explaining the menu and the cool way to order steaks. We all overate between the delicious salad bar and moth watering bread. I highly recommend adding bacon to the small filet. Enjoy!"
"I AM HEAD OVER HEELS FOR THIS PLACE!I've been to numerous high end restaurants, but this place just blows it out of place! Honestly, I've been back here over 10 times in the past year ... First of all, the salad bar is amazing! Their raspberry vinegrette sauce is like no other and has a unique kick to it. The CHEESE BREAD is on point. It's moist, soft, and crunchy. The cinnamon dipping sauce also compliments the bread perfectly well! && Their crackers and cream cheese -- (I believe it's raspberry chiili suace) are super satisfying!Every time that I've gone, I ALWAYS get the filet mignon. I just can't get over how flavorful, juicy, and fresh the flavors are! I usually get the 8 oz. to save room for dessert. Dessert: I LOVE the SNICKERS cake! If you're a chocolate lover like me, then you're not going to be disappointed. If I don't want something too sweet, I prefer the creme brulee or the boot drink (which has some alcohol) and you get the glass boot to take home! *** SERVICE is 200% better than what you will EVER receive in ANY high end restaurant. It's not those hit or miss places. Every time I come, the service just seems to get better! On special holidays and occasions, this place really takes it to the next level.YOU WON'T REGRET IT. The atmosphere can be casual or romantic!"
"Can't say enough about this great place. Family owned, wonderful environment, great wine list, celebration location. This is worth the wait."
"Took Chinese colleagues here who were visiting from beijing. It was a perfect choice for this occasion ... They loved picking out their own cut of meat, making a salad at the enormous salad bar, and getting their pic taken in cowboy hats and bandanas. For this event, it was a great place, but For all non-Chinese tourist entertainment event, when you just want a great steak, go to the other standard spots (Brenners, Eddie v, Capitol grille, or Ruth's Chris)."
"My husband and I have been here many times for several different occasions and we have never received anything but excellence in all areas. The whole place is clean with nice waiting areas and snacks/drinks for while you wait. Our service is always spot on with everyone being friendly, attentive and knowledgable of the menu. My husband and I always get a steak and and a side which comes with the salad bar. The salad bar has great salad and hot rolls and the steaks are full of flavor. I would rather come here than some place like Perry's. Taste of Texas is a nice place without being over the top. Sure the food is pricy but you don't have to dress up in a suit and tie to enjoy it. We bring all our out of town guests here when we get the chance and everyone always leaves happy."
"I was in town for the weekend and stayed across the street from this place. Saw the reviews on yelp and got excited when I heard we were having dinner here my first night in town! The salad bar is amazing, I loved the cilantro vinaigrette. I chose a marinated steak plate but my friend got the tomahawk and man that is no joke! It was amazing! And huge! We were so pleased with the appetizers and main meals that our jaws dropped when they brought over the dessert plate...yeah not menu, plate! I noticed a yummy one on the corner and the server began to explain it starting with snickers, uh-yeah I'm gonna let you stop right there, bring me that! But if you want a mouth watering dessert to finish up your meal with, ask for the chocolate cake. You won't regret it!I'm so happy I got to check this place out while I was in town, it was amazing!"
"One of my favorite restaurants in Houston. Everything about this place is great. The bar, service, and the food are outstanding. Best steaks in Houston."
"My husband and I waited hours to be seated expecting the wait would be well worth it. We were highly disappointed to say the least. My steak was burnt and flavorless, my husbands food was as bad if not worst! The best thing we had were the dinner rolls. Such a waste of money and time; Never Again!! I suggest you get a great steak from a local butcher and cook it at home, I know my husband has made far better steaks at home."
"A Filet mignon that is wrapped in bacon, rubbed in lemon pepper, and topped with garlic butter is the best steak served in Houston. Weekend waits can be about 1-2 hours so go early or drink at the bar. It's worth the wait and pricesI've been coming here for years and will always be coming back."
"I don't understand why this restaurant only 4 stars. It is truly spectacular. When arriving it was formal looking. I was a little worried about how we were dressed but the staff were welcoming. We got a table right away. Server was outstanding. Our water glasses were never empty and he always came over without interruption. I believe the meals were very well priced for the service and quality of food being provided. My husband and I shared the tomahawk steak. It was truly amazing. It was extremely tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned very well. Sides were a perfect addition to the steak. Dessert display plate was unbelievable and server was so perfect at explaining everything with great detail. My husband and I shared the sampler dessert plate and everything was incredible. All tasty and sweet and delicious. For 3 people the bill came to $136. That included steaks, sides and desserts. I believe it was more than reasonable."
"Our first choice to take our family out to eat a nice meal is Taste of Texas.  Delicious steaks, salad bar is incredible, and the ambiance is very warm.Our 8 and 10 yr old kids love it!  They have their own rhythm  when they go to the salad bar....my son loads up on the healthy greens, cheese, and other toppings....yum!My youngest daughter likes to eat the cinnamon butter straight from the little cup!  Ha!Thank you Taste of Texas for the many many great memories and delicious meals!"
This is one of my all time favorite restaurants.  I always pick this one for anniversaries and birthdays.  Yummy! Love their steaks and salad bar.  Their cheese rolls are to die for.  Their waitstaff and other employees are absolutely the best.  They must do a fabulous job of training and it works!
"The tomahawk ribeye looks like it ate several other, smaller, steaks on its way out to your table. Great steak- great restaurant."
"This place was soooo good! Super pricey though. Like seriously freaking pricey, but everything was delicious. My mom brought me, cuz she's been here before & really liked it. First they brought these little toasts to put this super tasty spread on. It was cream cheeseish with a pepper jelly. I ordered the tenderloin medallions, because they were like half the price of one of the regular steaks, but still came with a trip to the salad bar, which my mom had raved about. I ordered a port, someone's reserve....The waitress was pretty bad, she explained the menu to us after we ordered, even though she had already been to the table a few times. So I don't really do vegetables......cuz there's things like meat & cake in the world, but this salad was like the best I've ever had! There was real bacon! & the ceasar dressing tasted homemade, & there were huge blocks of cheese to take shavings off of. Also there were some wonderful rolls & a jalapeño cornbread. After we were almost done with our salads our waitress offered us pepper for our salads lol, poor thing she was late on everything. She also forgot our wines when she brought our food. The steak was cooked perfectly rare, it was so delicious & it had an amazing sauce that I wanted a whole bowl of. It came with asparagus which was pretty good. I traded my tomato for a baked potato, which was huge. Other than the potato, the portions were not Texas sized, especially for the price. The chocolate cake made up for it though, cuz it was huge. I won't be back often cuz it's so overpriced, & I honestly don't know why more ppl aren't bothered by the price, but it was really good."
"Forget the steaks, the salad bar alone is something to rave about! Let me just say, I was extremely hesitant upon our drive when I heard there was a salad bar only to be surprised with delight. I wasn't feeling steak the day we visited but I'll definitely be trying it out in the future. The desserts are presented to you in a huge platter, it's really hard to not take the whole thing. We got the creme brûlée, I can't wait to try more on our next stop into Taste of Texas!!"
"I took the hostess (who was so sweet) recommendation for a stuffed steak.  It was delicious.  The salad bar was clean, fresh and stocked.  Do not leave without eating steak!!"
"Taste of Texas is a gem steakhouse in Houston. No, you will not find this steakhouse in any other city in the United States. So if you're in Houston and you want to try non-chain restaurant steak, this is the place to go.The downside as I'm sure has been mentioned on here plenty of times, they don't take reservation. You better come early and you better have the whole party present or they will not sit you. Wait time could be hours. Yes, HOURS! But they do have a waiting area where you can get some chips, salsa, and free drinks (soda and water).Salad bar is great! Their breads are awesome and I especially LOVE their cinnamon butter!! I'm not a big fan of cinnamon, but their cinnamon butter is just to die for! Yum!Steak is not the best I've had. I personally prefer the steak from Ruth's Chris, but for the price and different selections of sauce, and bacon-wrapped filet mignon, I can't complaint. I won't complaint. I'm not saying their steaks aren't good. I'm just saying, they're not the best I've had, ok? I love their steak. The people that I've brought here have normally complimented the taste.Service is awesome! Excellent! Amazing! Can't get any better. Even during the one time I was seated at this waiter's section and he was super busy taking order at a different table with 12 people, I had other waiters coming to help me, taking my drink orders, taking my food orders, and making sure that i had everything I needed.  And when my waiter finally came around, he profusely apologized for not taking good care of me. His service from that point on? Amazing!if they would start taking reservations to cut down the wait time or if they finally decide to expand or open a second location with the same kind of quality and service. Maybe. Just maybe, they'll get a five stars rating from me."
"Had the skewers with vegetables and dirty rice, so delicious recommend this dish if you want more food for your money! Also had the golden margarita on the rocks  excellent customer service."
Had a great time celebrating my boyfriend's birthday this week. We went on a Monday night and there was no wait. Food was wonderful and the staff was very attentive.
"Excellent service.  On par for fine dining.  Prime rib and brussel sprouts were delicious.  The wait was long, but they try to be as accommodating as possible for the wait."
"Order Ribeye steak by the ounce and waiter will lead you to the butcher shop in the back and you can pick the meat and cut your own thickness ! And, Order this comes with their great salad bar !"
"LOVE Taste of Texas!! This steak house is what a ""Texas"" steakhouse is supposed to be.. I was there recently celebrating an anniversary. To start off the wonderful evening; I asked the waiter to recommend some wine, since I generally don't drink. Upon hearing the occasion we were there, he offered up ""something special"" for dessert if we had room.The steaks we ordered were perfect. MUST order the butter sauce & Garlic sauce again!! We decided to plurge; so we went up to the inhouse butcher shop and picked out our steaks.. That was pretty cool.Salad bar was very large. Huge slabs of different cheeses waiting to be sliced into was a neat idea.The atmosphere in this place was TOTALLY TEXAS! Taxidermied(sp) deer heads fill the wall along with other trophies. I thought the owners were big hunters, but the waiter tells me that ""friends"" of the restaurant donate their trophies for bragging rights.Cannot go wrong with this place. I couldnt say how much the final bill was, but i DIDNT have sticker shock; whatever it was.."
"If I could give this place 6 starts I would. Today was a very very special day and to celebrate my better half and I decided to go to Taste of Texas.Half of our order wasn't cooked as we had specified. The manager came over and was more than happy to have the steak re-fired. When the steak came out it was wrong again. We were not upset. Things happen sometimes and ya gotta give some slack sometimes.The issue was resolved and we were very pleased. I just want to give a shout out to the stars who made our special meal memorable.Josh was our server, he was very knowledgeable, super friendly and gave superior service. He obviously has been there a while...and his experience shows.Scott was the first Manager we encountered and he was very apologetic and was very seriously trying to make sure we were happy with our dining experience. Scott was as professional and concerned as any Manager should be.Michael was the final Manager to come over and make sure everything was good. His visit to our table was not necessary but sure capped a special evening. Michael, like Scott was professional and concerned that we had a great experience.To the Taste of Texas Team and those we mentioned....Thank you very much for doing a great job providing a superior dining experience. I hope your Boss appreciates your efforts"
Wow. What a great experience. I flew in from San Diego and have never been to Houston. My hotel recommended Taste of Texas. I am glad they did. Salad bar amazing. I had the steak medallions. Wow. They were perfect!  It was busy song are at the bar. So glad I did. Bartenders were outstanding!  I will go out of y way to eat here.
"The steak is fresh and juicy, and you can even pick the one you like. There is also a salad bar in the back. The salad is pretty delicious. If it's your first time, don't forget to tell them and you'll get a photo taken for free in a cowboy dress, which is awesome"
"A girl only turns Sweet 16 once but it still surprised me that she wanted to come to ToT since we have never been. I was glad to accomodate but forgot that they do not take reservations for small parties. I get it. So, the wait on a Thursday night was 45 min to an hour and I think we actually waited 30 something. Plenty of room to wait in bar area, foyer or better yet, outside. Once seated in the wine room, Jason our server came by promptly and asked the proverbial question, ""Has everyone been here before"", or something like that. He was happy to explain the menu. Let us know that one side and salad bar were included with the steaks, then gave us a few minutes to decide on appetizer. Like most steakhouses, they are well trained on the recommendations and upsell for just about everything. We started with spinach dip with tostada chips and it was stellar. Salad bar had great options including fruit, cheese and bread. All of us chose steak. All come with either lemon pepper, garlic butter or blue cheese butter. Service throughout the evening was on point and we never wanted for more of anything that he didnt already anticipate. The angus steaks were perfected cooked and with the exception of the mac and cheese, all the sides were outstanding (asparagus with hollandaise, au gratin potato, baked potato etc.Birthday girl enjoyed a dessert of her choice and it came with a sparkler and a paper framed photo of her blowing it out ( nice touch ). Lets face it. Steakhouses for the most part are not an exceptional value in terms of price. Having said that, the quality of ToT is outstanding while not grandiose in presentation. Its no wonder Edd and Mary Hendee have been in business since 1977. First class operation."
Fantastic experience from start to finish! Melissa was our waitress and it's obvious she loves what she does. She made the whole dinner fun and interesting for our 3 young kids and even cut their steaks up for them (wouldn't let us do it) so we could enjoy eating ourselves. After dinner she took them to the kitchen for complimentary ice cream. The food was great... From the breads to the salad bar to the stuffed Shrimp Jalapeños for an appetizer to Prime Rib and Filet. Cooked perfectly and we are it all! Would definitely come back when we're in Houston again.
"Back again for lunch yesterday. I love this place. Delicious food, fantastic service, awesome atmosphere. Taste of Texas is a must visit when in Houston!!"
"Recommendations:-Cowboy Steak-Mac & Cheese-Rolls with Cinnamon ButterTip:-Put your name on the list at least an hour before time you intend to eat.I've been wanting to go to this place for a while because of my friends who speak highly of this restaurant.  We ended up waiting 45 minutes or so on a Saturday night (not bad at all) and ate the complimentary chips and salsa, which were pretty addicting.  My party came in blocks but the waiter was very patient and didn't rush the ones who came in early to order.  I got the Cowboy Steak with garlic pepper and lemon pepper seasoning paired with a Cabernet and it came out perfect!  I also had the baked potato, but out of the all the sides I tried from my friends (mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, baked potato), I thought the mac and cheese was the best one.  One of my friend's steak wasn't cooked to her liking so they immediately made another one and came back within 10 minutes!  The managers came by personally to make sure everything was great and even offered free dessert and a hot side for the mishap.  I will definitely be coming back again!"
I love love love going to the taste of Texas for steak. It's one of my favorite steakhouses in town. I will starve myself a day in advance just so I can have as much of the salad bar and sides as possible. Even then I end up taking home leftovers. The servers are polite and helpful. Parking can sometimes be a challenge and wait times can be long at times but it's totally worth it.
"We came for an intimate birthday.  Seems appealing for cowboy types (one man kept his hat on!), rustic charm? lotsa wood and guns.  Very casual - mostly older crowd, Caucasian.  Made me think of Denny's.  Birthday boy loved it.Plus-attentive service-baked brie-rib eye was juicy-asparagus side-cheesecakeAreas off improvement-salad bar - just OK-wilted spinach too garlicky$200 for four with tip - no etoh.  I think overpriced."
"We came here for one of my friend's birthdays and it was not a let down. We had to wait a pretty long time, but I guess that's expected for a big party on a Saturday afternoon. I think the wait was about an hour? Possibly longer, but while you wait you can get sodas and popcorn and there's plenty of seating so you don't have to stand. When we got seated out waiter directed us to the salad bar. The cheese bread was delicious! It was warm, moist, soft - everything you want in cheese bread. The steak...was served perfectly. I ordered medium rare and my plate was burning hot and you can instantly smell your steak making your mouth really water.I got asparagus as a side which went well with my steak and my girlfriend got mash potatoes with the New York strip. Some additional notes, the interior is decorated like a cabin, very southern and Texas-y. The birthday girl did get a dessert of her choice but most of us were too full by the end to eat any."
This was the first time with my colleague in Houston. We loved the service quality and the taste of Tomahawk steak. We strongly suggest this restaurant.
"By far the best restaurant I have been to. The salad bar is so fresh and the breads are to die for. The steaks are always cooked to perfection. The wait staff is amazing, explain. Exactly what you want and it will happen! Save room for dessert, everything is amazing weather it be rich or light. I always get the 6oz center cut with broccoli and hollondaise, a trip to the salad bar, and I always try a new dessert and  never disappointed."
"How good is Taste of Texas?  Let's just say I went there on a SCHOOL FIELD TRIP when I was in elementary school!  Fast forward to today and elementary schools are still going there for field trips.  At my son's elementary school, it is the 4th grade field trip... and you better believe I will try to be a chaperon for that one!Not only does Taste of Texas have amazing food but it's also a Houston legend and rightfully so!  Taste of Texas is our go-to place for birthdays, anniversaries, or just when we are craving a great steak.  Sure this is Houston, you can get a great steak in a handful of places throughout the city but no other restaurant has Taste of Texas's charm and they sure don't have Taste of Texas' salad bar!    My husband and I usually split the Porterhouse for Two which is no longer listed on their menu but they still offer it.  You can't go wrong with half a filet and half a strip.  It also comes with two sides, one for each person and of course the salad bar.  Just a warning though, when ordering the Porterhouse for Two, it looks like they are charging you for an ""extra"" salad bar but the total price is correct.  They have to do that since it's not technically on the menu.  If you live in Houston, you have to experience Taste of Texas at least once in your life.  If you have friends or family coming in from out of town, this is definitely a great spot to take them especially if they are not from this great state of Texas!  Be prepare to wait since they do not take reservations but it's well worth it!"
"The salmon dish is absolutely, mouth watering delicious! They have a beautiful salad bar full of colorful vegetables and tasty fruit!"
"Sorry, but I will not wait 2 hours for anything. ANYTHING! I wish ToT would take reservations. At least for the holidays.Sorry, can't give 5 stars to a place that charges the same price as other reservation accepted places and expects you to wait. And the free soft drinks & popcorn are a crappy bribe to hang around. :P"
"You simply can't beat this place. It is, by far, my favorite place to get a steak in Houston. (And that is saying a lot.... because I like steak. A lot.) From the food to the service, I've never had a bad experience. They have had a little bit of a menu change recently but, for the most part, you won't even notice the difference. Their salad bar, complete with self-serve bread case is not to be skipped. This is the place I take people who visit from out of town. There may be a bit of a wait because they don't accept reservations, but it is well worth it. Trust me. Jessica approved: the filets, the prime rib, the bacon wrapped quail bites (don't ask questions, just order them), and their wedge salad is beautiful."
I absolutely love this place. Their food and service is always on point. Everyone must their cilantro vinaigrette!
"This place is overrated as hell. The steak quality is not that good, think of this as a slightly better Logan's. The best steak I had in a restaurant was at a place called houstons and this place comes nowhere near it. The select your own steak is honestly just a gimmick, it won't change the flavor of your steak. I ordered a steak lovers bread and butter- a large ribeye- that steak lacked in so much flavor it was embarrassing. The only thing Texas about this place is the size"
"My sister brought me here for my birthday, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense considering she's a vegetarian and I don't eat beef.  The reason she wanted to come here is because apparently the salad bar is something you dream about.On a Thursday evening, there was zero wait for a table.  We were seated and went off to the salad bar.  Uhhhh......who dreams about this??  There was 2 types of salad blends, spring mix and romaine if I remember correctly, a couple of different types of dressing as well as the usuals, the usual toppings (croutons, sesame seeds, bacon), usual veggies, usual everything.  The website even describes the salad bar as ""amazing"".  What??  They do have fresh bread, which was uh-mazing!  When we got back to the table, I ordered a chicken breast since I knew this salad bar wasn't going to sustain me for the rest of the night.  The chicken was just ok.We ordered raspberry cheesecake for dessert (although NOT complimentary for me)  It was by far the best part if the meal.  It was pretty giant, enough for 2 people to share without fighting about intruding on one's side of the slice.  The coulis was awesome and tangy.  The real stuff, as it should be, not the corn syrupy mess you usually get."
"This is my very favorite place to go. Greatest salad bar in town.My dad took me to lunch, he is 82, and the prices had gone up, he could not get a house red wine and the least expensive glass of red was $12.95?? We eat at a lot of nice places and the house merlot is $4-$5.He was very disappointed. I love the staff and decor but the restaurant is just catering to the over paid people working all around them. A split  entree, 2 salad bars and water cost $40 with tip. He said, next time Pappadeux.Also, I went for my birhday and they had the most amazing shrimp appetizer, best shrimp EVER, but no, nest time they have changed it to a few on a glass that is smoking...a real let down...I do appreciate the family and what they do for staff and the community."
"The meat is BIG here. But once the novelty wears off, you may realize like me, that the salad bar is one of the real highlights. The steak is ok... not bad, by any means... but it wasn't the best either. The meat was definitely cooked a little more than ""med rare"" for me, and they drenched it in garlic butter (which tasted alright, but sort of masked the meat). One of the coolest highlights is the free snacks and drinks they offer you when you have to wait an absurdly long time in their waiting area.It's definitely a place you'll want to try at least once."
"If only this place was a ""hospitality house"" or a ""salad bar house"" instead of a ""steak house"".  Then it would get 5 stars.So let's get straight to my biggest beef (pun totally intended):  The lack of reservations.  Look, guys, you have to have some pretty freaking amazing beef for me not to wait in line for an hour (or hourS).  On top of that, why are you guys so dang hospitable and friendly... yet you don't want to go to the trouble of having reservations?  Here, let me make it easy for you:  Have half of your restaurant available for reservations.  The other half is first-come first-served.  Once the reservation half is full for the night, you don't make any more reservations and you tell people to just come in.  Thne you institute a severely short grace period for late diners (say, 5 minutes) before their table becomes available for the people waiting.  Voila!  You satisfy those of us who like to plan ahead, and not wait, while also satisfying the people who like a little more ""excitement"" in their life.See, when it comes right down to it, if you offer the same product - or even one that's slightly inferior - as any other steakhouse in the area, but you make it loads more difficult for me to obtain that product, I just won't frequent you.  What's the point?  My intent on nights out isn't to spend the majority of my time sucking down a generic beer from your terrible draft selection while munching on greasy stale popcorn filler.In case you're wondering, I went to this place because my boyfriend wanted to go here for his birthday.  Had it been my call, once I heard they didn't take reservations, I would have picked any of another 50 excellent steakhouses in the area and been quite happy.  On that note I hope he never reads this review...All right, rant over.  Let's get to the rest of it.  The salad bar:  Pretty darn good.  The bread bar and associated butters and jams and whatnot:  Worth a mention because it's just that good.  Appetizers:  We got the popcorn shrimp.  Thumbs up.The steak:  I got the cowboy steak.  Ribeye, medium rare.  It was... ok.  Not spectacular.  Not write-home-I'm-in-love-now great.  Just ok.  It's telling when the server presses you to include the house's specialty seasonings or butter on your steak - shouldn't the steak speak for itself?  You can choose your own steak cut, by the way.  We did this.  I should have realized right then that my cowboy ribeye wasn't going to be good because none of the cuts looked better than average.The boyfriend got the T-bone, also medium rare.  Now that was pretty good.  Not the best I've ever had, but pretty darn good.Once the waiter found out it was my boyfriend's birthday, he got us dessert (key lime pie, amaaaazing, and I still thought it was delicious despite the fact that I was about to explode from too much food).  Also, he took a picture of us and printed it out before we left.  That's so nice!Sorry, Taste of Texas, you were so hospitable and eager to please - but only once I'd sat down at a table.  And if only I could grade you on everything BUT the steak.  Unfortunately I just can't do that, just as I unfortunately won't be returning."
"My favorite steak house, worth the wait that one will inevitably have to go through to be seated.It's not as bad, though, as they have a side waiting area with fountain drinks, chips and salsa, popcorn and a bar. The service is awesome, the servers are always attentive and nice.The steak here is amazing (I always get the center cut filet, rare) but the salad bar is pretty darn awesome, too, with huge cheese blocks one can shave off slices of cheese and fresh bread that's kept warm in a bread warmer cabinet. I also really love the cilantro dressing and the real bacon.Okay, more on the steak. Like I said, I always get the center cut filet, rare, with the garlic butter. It's just omigah melt in your mouth amazing. Never fails to disappoint! The options are to get the steak butterflied and to also get it bacon wrapped. While bacon is awesome, I let the steak sing in my mouth by itself.My brothers and father usually get the prime rib and it's always a winner, also. I've also have tried the new york strip and the porterhouse (other's, not mine) and it's similarly awesome.Okay, everything is awesome. Check it out, be it for a special occasion or if you just want really excellent steak. :D"
"Love their ribeye-juicy, but the T bone is just Ok. The sautéed mushroom is awesome. Nice restaurant, nice service."
"If I were rich, I'd eat here more often. My boyfriend and I usually share an 18oz prime rib. Goodness gracious it was my first time ever eating a prime rib and I immediately fell in love with it at first whiff of it. I don't think I will ever go back to filet mignon... It was soooo goood!!!! Ordering tip: they're scale is off by like a notch, so if you like medium rare, order a medium and it'll come out perfect. Otherwise you might get a little too much blood on your plate.Salad bar: I think enough has been said about their fantastic salad bar.  A mini heating oven for their breads: jalepeno cornbread, jalepeno cheese, and regular dinner rolls (or mini loaves). Salad: spring mix, spinach, lettuce, broccoli, olives, beans, beets, mushroom--ANYTHING you can think of for throwing in your salad. Even nuts and fruits! And cheese that you can personally grate from the block yourself! I wish I could take their dessert platter home with me. My family loves their creme brulee, but I cannot stray away from their pecan pie. Oh my goodness... it's a freaking deep dish pie too. Yet my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it even after our 18 oz prime rib and all-you-can-eat salad and dinner rolls... They also have cheesecake, snicker's pie, etc.Decor? Very nice and romantic setting. It's Christmas season so they have lights and seasonal decor on the walls and everything. Beware of 1-hr waits during busy hours on the weekends! They don't take reservation."
"What can i say that hasn't been said here already ???Perhaps that I was blown away by the deco, the staff, the attention to detail, the salad bar, the picking of the meat, the tenderness and taste of my porterhouse steak, and, truly, the best ""ensemble cast"" experience I've had in a long time !"
"Wow! Just Wow!When I am next in Houston I will be eating at Taste of Texas!!!Good quality beef, cooked perfectly to order.Our wait time on arrival was approx 60mins (arrived at 8pm). The wait was worth it and complimentary refreshments were available.We ate well and bill came to $150. Service was fantastic and the added touches and the way they treat tourists is commendable.Quite deservedly a Houston institution and I look forward to visiting again, whenever that may be.Thank you."
Taste of Texas is the best run restaurant in the Houston area. It is also the quintessential Houston Steakhouse. The steaks are always cooked perfectly and the salad bar is amazing. My wife and I have made this our anniversary spot. I hope Taste of Texas will be open for all of our anniversaries.
"This place is absolutely heaven. I still cannot believe they have a waiting room full of snacks - which was worth the 1 hour wait. They have popcorn, nachos and soda, which is something most restaurants don't do. As soon as I walked in, I was very tempted by the garlic smell. Since my family and I were visiting, we got free bandanas, which is a symbol of Texas. This place is so beautiful with the Christmas decorations all over and every meal comes with a salad bar, which is small but very tasty.Forgive me for not being a Texan who doesn't know what a 'genuine' steak tastes like but my t-bone steak was delicious - juicy and tender! At least way better than what I taste back home. And as for the steak fries, yum!"
"When you think Texas you think steak house, but you haven't eaten at a realTexas restaurant until you've eaten here, it's perfect for any occasion. Delicious food great service and amazing salad bar! But don't full up on just the salad and bread, the food is spectacular! Great to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries every Houstonian has to come here at least once!"
Kind of ironic that I would comment on my experience here! I am a vegetarian and this place is completely vegetarian friendly! My sister says that she loves the steaks! The salad bar is excellent and so are their side dishes!! The place is always packed and has a great vibe .. I always visit when I am in town!!
"Went to the kitchen and got to choose my own steak which was cooked med rare to perfection. Salad bar was delicious along with the bread, Mac and cheese was really good. Manager treated us with a 50 dollar gift card because guest across from our table were being loud and cursing. One of the best customer service I have experienced. Will be going back soon."
We dine here every Mother's Day and Father's Day and every chance in between! The steaks are flavorful and fresh. The staff members are pleasant. I just love the atmosphere!
"EVERYTHING is so delicious! Don't get discouraged if you have a long wait because the waiting area is cozy and has it's own bar service along with complimentary chips and salsa, popcorn, sodas, and iced tea. But don't fill up on the free stuff because the food you're going to pay for is going to be GOOD and there will be a lot of it!Spend the money, get an appetizer. Try the salad bar too, it's outstanding! You cannot come here without getting a steak as your entree, if you get something else, SHAME ON YOU!Ask the waiters questions, they know what they're talking about. They will inform you on anything you need to know.Enjoy!!!"
"Best place in town. Takes forever to get a table, but always worth it. Not only is the food great, but the service is amazing. They are very accommodating to large groups and children too."
"My first time at Taste of Texas was during my 7th grade. Our class took a field trip to learn about Texas history and got a lunch of chicken tenders, which were delicious for my 7th grade palette.Fast forward 10+ years and I was asked if I've ever been to this restaurant. Being me and not doing any research as it was based on my past experience, I exclaimed, ""Of course! They have delicious chicken tenders!"" And....cue the weird stares I received from people. I probably should have done at least a quick yelp search to realize Taste of Texas was a famous steakhouse. Whoops! No wonder I caused a room of 5+ people to go silent...So one day before Christmas, my boss decided to treat us to Taste of Texas for lunch for a job well done. Of course because he kept it a secret and the restaurant doesn't take reservations, he wasn't able get us to leave for an early lunch. As such we ended up with an hour wait which he had no problem blaming us for. So we entertained ourselves with the free soda and popcorn in the waiting room.Once we finally were able to sit and ordered, I debated getting a steak, but decided against it since I didn't want to end up napping half way through the afternoon. A very poor decision as I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which were just okay. Definitely should have tried their steak! Now I'll definitely have to come back. In addition, the salad bar was great as it provided a lot of fresh options. Overall, I think this is a great restaurant to bring guests as its a very family friendly atmosphere rather than romantic. They also have a lot of Texas items which I think gives this place character. Definitely worth a visit."
"food to die for. had a superb time, the salad bar is a big plus."
"3.5 stars, for just the salad bar, of which I am definitely a fan! i love love luuuuuv the salad bar, and also the cheese rolls and jalapeno corn bread, of course!  The raspberry vinaigrette dressing is yummy, and it is fun to shred cheese from the big blocks of cheese!  However, the entree that I had last evening, Grilled Tenderloin Medallions, sorta sucked! Included in the entree, the baked Blue cheese stuffed tomato was scrumptious; other than that, everything else, including the fried onion strings, fresh asparagus, and the steak itself in Bordelaise sauce, was just so-so.  Next time I go to Taste to Texas, I will order just the salad bar as a meal, seriously! hahaa :)"
"Tomahawk steak is all you really need to know. Probably one of the best meals you will never eat in your life. Good stuff!The wait can be long, but its well worth it. You can pick out steaks from the back and that is pretty awesome. It is definitely a formal feel. I eat here with coworkers everytime I am in H-town!"
"Excellent food and salad bar.  Great ambiance and great service.  A few recommendations:Perry's has you beat on Martinis.  Change your martini glasses and change your blue cheese stuffed olives.  The blue cheese is very hard and not very tasty.  In addition, have your bartenders shake the martinis properly so that ice crystals form when shaken.  Visit Perry's for a better understanding.Fix your parking problem.  I shouldn't have to park over at the little motel across the street to dine at your restaurant.  Build a parking garage if that's what it takes.  You charge your patrons enough to fix your parking issues.Serve all your steaks on the sizzling platters.  The white rectangular plates are not as nice as the sizzling platters.So, everything was not ""just perfect"" but it was tasty and I did enjoy myself.Thanks"
always a great place to go.  Love the decor at Christmas time !  Wish they took reservations though.  That keeps me from going very often.
2 thumbs up for the wonderful foods and excellent services for our Anniversary dinner with a few of our out of country family members.  They were impressed by taste of Texas!  Thank you for the free desserts with our meals to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and many other services including taking our pictures for keepsakes.
"We went on a Friday around 8pm and our estimated wait time was 90-120 minutes. They do provide free chips and salsa, popcorn, and sodas on an adjacent lounge/wait area. This definitely helps.Our wait was about 70 minutes to be exact. Not so terrible. We ordered a 16 oz New York strip and the T-bone steak. Entrees come with a salad bar which was very nicely stocked with fresh veggies, cheeses, real bacon bits, and freshly baked sweet rolls. And the cilantro vinaigrette was fantastic.The waiter recommended the lemon pepper seasoning with garlic butter which really enhanced the flavor of the meat. The steaks were both cooked well although mine was leaning a bit more towards medium well...but no harm. We got the steak fries (yay) and  sauteed mushrooms (yawn) for our sides. We were way too full to order dessert but that tray was full of awesomeness. Maybe next time we'll just split one steak and  get something sweet in the end.Yes, the wait is ridiculous, and no it's not cheap. But Taste of Texas is totally worth it."
"Our service was very good, but our steaks were over cooked. For the price, we felt like the steaks should've been better. Perry's Steakhouse is better in my opinion  and comparable."
I give this 5 stars because it is just a great Texas steak house experience.  I've been here several times and nothing disappoints except the wait.  Steaks are always good and the salad bar is great.  Potato soup is grand but probably has a few days worth of calories in it... But who's counting so now on to dessert... Bread pudding is delish!  This is a Houston visitor or local must.
"This place has a lot of southern flair. Eating here makes me proud to be from Texas, they definitely do steak right!There will most likely be a long wait if you come here on a busy night, but their waiting area is spacious and comfortable, and you can help yourself to complimentary snacks and beverages as you wait. This is a really nice perk for me, because nothing makes me crankier than being hungry and having to deal with a long wait while people are getting served food all around you.I expected a buffet-like salad bar with the basics (some shredded lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, croutons, and cheese) but there are actually some gourmet offerings, and a nice assortment of dressings. I liked their fresh-baked rolls and jalepeno cornbread too, it was difficult not to fill up on those!Oh man, and there is nothing like a dry aged steak here. Fiance and I usually split the porterhouse for two, which is probably the most bang for your buck item on the menu. You can actually choose your own steak for them to prepare too. It is always cooked to medium rare perfection, the fillet has such an amazing melt-in-your-mouth texture. Save room for dessert! BEST PECAN PIE EVER. A generous serving with good pecan/filling/crust ratio. I liked the shortbread crust a lot, it wasn't too sweet and complimeted the filling well. The filling wasn't too gelatin-like, nothing kills a pecan pie like a globby filling.The servers are attentive and really know the menu very well.Love, love, love this place. I wish I could eat here everyday, but my wallet and my midsection would definitely take a hit. Other steakhouses have a lot to learn from Taste of Texas."
Love the environment and that I can choose my cut of meat.  Service was great.  Great location and good for work meetings and or date night.
"I was first introduced to Nina and Edd Hendee's Houston landmark as child during an elementary school field trip. Nina took us on a guided tour of the historical artifacts throughout her restaurant. After touring the steakhouse, she feed us what I fondly remember as ""the best school lunch EVER"". Prior to moving to the Pacific NW, my sister and I would always look forward to our birthdays when our parents would treat us to a fancy dinner at Taste of Texas. It has been 15 years since my last visit to Nina and Edd's steakhouse. I recently had a quick visit home from Portland, Oregon. With only 24 hours in Houston, the only restaurant that I absolutely had to visit was Taste of Texas. The experience was every bit of what I remember growing up. The hostess and server (Bill) were prompt, patient and so very kind. Bill anticipated our every need. The food was simply delicious. We started our dining experience with a trip to their salad bar complete with an assortment of warm, freshly baked bread and cinnamon butter. My Dad and I each ordered their 6 oz. bacon-wrapped and aged to perfection Certified Angus filet topped with melted garlic butter and paired with sautéed mushrooms and grilled shrimp. Everything was cooked to perfection. For dessert we split a slice of warm pecan pie topped with vanilla ice cream. It was to-die-for. Bill overheard how much I loved their bread and cinnamon butter so he packed up a sweet little To-Go box for me to enjoy during my plane ride home. Our experience was everything that I remembered, anticipated and craved. Thank you, Nina and Edd. An evening at your beautiful restaurant never disappoints. I look forward to my next trip home and another delicious meal while back in Houston. #GodBlessTexas"
"We have eaten here twice. We have yet to wait as long as they say. Visit their room to the right. Complimentary chips and salsa, popcorn, and soft drinks. Celebrating?  Tell them. They will make it special for you. I got soup and their amazing salad bar for 11.95."
Never ever had a bad meal or service here!!They pride themselves on their restaurant and it shows. I always leave this place happy and I honestly always get exactly what I came for. That's exactly how it should be! We eat here once a year with our a huge group of extended family when they come into town and it's always awesome!
"I was visiting Houston just for 2 days, and since there was pretty much nothing to do in this city, before leaving the only attraction (the mall), I told my sister: Yelp me the best steak place around here. We were all lucky, we found Taste of Texas and did not have to wait. The service was wonderful. The portion was enormous, we ordered 2 12 oz rib eye plates to share among 3 people and it was more than enough. Our steak was made to order, we could even instruct on how it should be cut. Do they have a butcher on site? Is the farm at the back? We're so clueless, we're Yankee tourists..Other than that, the salad ingredients were very fresh. I had asparagus, which was amazing too. And ever since, steak has only been tasting bland and lame up here in New England. I usually casually reply to ""How's everything"" from servers with ""Great"" - but now I often legitimately look disappointed and tell them ""It's okay. You know, I just came back from Texas."""
Taste of Texas have the best  steaks in Houston and their food are usually good. The only concern I have at the restaurant is that I wish the hospitality was a little better. I'm comparing their service to le peep at woodway where le peep had awesome service. Taste of Texas is still my favorite restaurant and I would still go here.
"Very *big* Houston steakhouse. Decent service. Steaks are OK but not as good as Pappas Steakhouse or the Republic in College Station. I think the thing I like best about this place is the salad bar - lots of fresh lettuce, vegetables, and freshly baked bread and cornbread. Worth checking out."
"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this restaurant, the waiter, salad bar, food and wine ALL amazing!!! It is a very classy place, definitely on the pricey side, the wines were extremely marked up. I ordered the grilled tuna and it was so fresh and juicy. My boyfriend ordered the crusted grilled chicken and he loved it! The salad bar has a ton of options to choose from and everything is fresh!! They also offer the option of picking our your own steak if you are into that kind of thing. Right now they have it decorated for Christmas with lights :)"
"Been going here for years. My grandpa used to take his co-workers here before my parent's met! It's the perfect place to celebrate a birthday, and everyone makes you feel welcome. A guaranteed good meal!"
"Huge, sizzling, tender, and delectable are some of the words to describe their steak. The Taste of Texas is hands down one of the best steaks I have had in my life (I had the T-bone steak)! The restaurant has a quirky western décor with low lights to create some intimacy. The restaurant is more upscale but the staff and service was friendly and informative. One of the more fascinating features is the option to actually choose your own steak from T-bone to filet mignon. You can actually see and choose the steak before it is cooked, and get to appreciate the beautiful marbelization of your steak. The steak dinner also comes with your standard salad bar which also includes delicious jalapeno cornbread with small cups of honey to be drizzled onto the cornbread. If you're not so much into steak they also have other entrée choices but you're missing out. Overall, steak dinners can range around $50 or more and entrées between $15-25. If you're ever in Houston and you're craving a delicious steak you have to visit Taste of Texas. Side note: If it's your birthday let your server know! You'll get a free dessert and picture compliments of Taste of Texas."
"The steak was high quality and huge!! Though it is not marinated or seasoned until cook, all they put was garlic butter on top of the steak. The bacon wrapped quails was just ok. What impressed me the most was the salad bar, variety of fresh vegetable and breads."
Cornbread is perfect and the service is very well trained. I just was not blown away with the prime rib I ordered. maybe next time it will be better.
"Great Steaks, Great salad bar, great ambiance Best value for upscale Steak in Houston. I'll pass on Capital grill (way overdone) Ill pass on Tony's (way overpriced) I'll pass on Flemings and the like- for the best Value and a great steak come here. You will get a history lesson about Houston as well. The other food is just ok. Stick with the steak and salad bar. The bread option at the salad bar is great with the spreads they offer.  I also feel the Pecan Pie here is some the best I have ever had."
Nina and Edd Hendee have a class we'll run restaurant that is one of the best in Texas. AND they are wonderful people outside the business
"Best steak I've ever had! I keep coming back here, the service is top notch, salad bar is great, and the steaks are amazing! No complaints whatsoever. Can't wait to go back!"
"My family and I go once a year to Taste of Texas. It's a great experience for us to go and have a great meal together like that. I've gone when we've had to wait for over an hour and I've gone when we've only had to wait about 20 minutes. Would like for them to accept reservations but it isn't bad. They do offer free drinks, popcorn and chips and salsa while you wait. Once seated the waiters are VERY friendly. They ask if you have been there before and really make it special when it's your first time there. Not sure if they still do this but if it's your first time they bring you a bandana and you can wear it if you like, just a nice gesture. I think it's only for international visitors though.The food is spectacular. If you're going to Taste of Texas, you're mainly only going for the steak. You can pick whatever cut you want from the butcher in the back. You can have it plain or add the garlic seasons they have which is great. Most meals come with the salad bar which is filled with great toppings. Bacon, nuts, peppers, whatever you think of they have for your salad. At the end of the marvelous salad bar you find a box full of baked goodies. Small bread loafs, butter croissants and my personal favorite, jalapeño corn bread. Overall just great food, never have tried anything not deserving to be on their menu. Will continue to go to Taste of Texas, they have great service, excellent food and just a great place to go with your family."
This is my all time favorite steak house. Taste of Texas has the best quality food all around-from their produce to their steaks. The salad bar is amazing and the service has always been stellar. Plus they feed you while you wait for a table! Thank you Taste of Texas for setting such a wonderful example of a quality top notch Texas restaurant. Well done! (Pun intended!)
"Good service. Nice restaurant to bring your love ones, friends, etc. Restaurant is clean, salad bar is small but delicious."
"Okay, the steak was good. The Filet was soft and very moist.The rest of the experience is where I have the issue. I came with a large corporate group and these guys sold the hell out of us.Made us order tons and tons of appetizers and took dessert orders before anything else. I mean, we even said ""can we order later"" and the waitress said because we're a large crowd blah blah blah.Either way, they cashed out several more G's than they should have.I would definitely return. With one other person for just the steak. Then again, there are other great Steak joints... Well, if I'm in Houston, I'll come back."
This place has the best steaks!!! No other place comes close! The sevice is amazing and the food is just the BEST!  Definitely a place you have to check out if you're in Houston!
"Enjoyed dinner for my Father's 90th birthday. The food was good. Service was excellent. Wait time for a large party was 2 hours. May want to consider taking reservations, maybe with a deposit, for large parties to avoid the wait. Overall experience was good. Will return again."
"There are many places in Houston that can hanker out a good tender and flavorful piece of steak. There are many backyard pits / grills that could do the same. Thus, I give this place 4 stars not because it has good, tender steak - which it does - but because of the extras. Salad bar - it ain't no Fogo's bar, but it still has a great fresh selection. Greens, fresh fruit, and pasta salads.Bread - jalapeno cornbread, mama's old fashioned buttery rolls, and cheese bread shaped like a cinnamon roll! kept warm and available next to the salad bar. Best part is the honey cinnamon butter and jam that goes with them.Expect a wait, at least an hour during busy times (weekends), since there are no reservations. But fear not, you can stuff yourself with free soda, popcorn, and chips outside as you wait - it'll make the hour feel a lot shorter. Stuffed to your heart's desire after your meal? Even if you tell them you're too full for dessert, they will bring out a platter of all the desserts they offer. In a perfect world, you would be able to look at that platter and say, ""no, thanks"". But in reality, we are fatties by nature. Plus, dessert goes to another stomach anyway. That being said, when they offer you dessert after you said you don't want any, make sure you try their key lime pie and their Oreo cheesecake! Only thing that I suggest to them: a steakhouse without mac n cheese as a side?! Almost blasphemous. Luckily your cattle make up for it. I'll be back (when I've saved up enough to drop some bill$)."
"My babe took me here a few months ago for an early dinner simply because he wanted me to share the experience of a new steak house restaurant with him.  His friends and others have recommended it to him. I was looking forward to it.  We arrived early since we knew this place would get packed.  This was a huge steak house with high ceilings.  If you do have to wait, there is a waiting area where you can get  popcorn, beverages, and other free snacks.  We didn't have to wait long but I managed to take along a sprite with me to my table.  Our hostess took us to a seating area far from the salad bar area.As with other steak houses, we got to see our meat prior to ordering.  Instead of bringing it to the table as other steakhouses, we got to go pick out our own meat for ourselves.  This was located next to the salad bar area.  We went with the double porterhouse steak since it was the best deal. It also came with access to the salad bar area.  Keep in mind that you only get one visit to the salad bar area so make it worthwhile.  The salad bar area was very nice.  It had a great selection of salads, dressings, cheese, rolls, etc.  Plates can be a bit small so choose wisely.  This was actually my favorite part of the meal.We weren't sure how long it would take so we ordered some spinach & artichoke dip.  While we were seated, they provided us with some chips along with salsa & cream cheese dip.  This was yummy.  We also got a glass of wine to go along with our steak  Little did we know that our appetizer and steak came out at the same time.  We were overwhelmed with food.  Imagine a small table full of bread, spread, chips, dips, spinach & artichoke dip, huge steak, and drinks.  If the food didn't come out all at once, I would have probably enjoyed it more.  The steak was a bit under seasoned. It wasn't the best steak I've had but it was good.Surprisingly, I was not impress with this particular steak house.  The price for everything including dessert was less than LA fares.  The servers and hostess were very attentive.  I even requested bernaise sauce for my steak.  It wasn't as good as Nick & Stef's in LA.I will probably visit this only for the salad bar or if I wish to bring family/friends visiting Texas."
"Such a true Texas steak house.   Nothing beats the southern hospitality you feel walking into this place.I normally order the prime rib, today it was a bit overcooked.  Order it medium rare.Cowboy ribeye amazing!!Key lime pie delicious!  Dessert platter that they display and explain all the desserts is such a rarity now and days with restaurants trying to hustle patrons in and out.  Dining at Taste of Texas, they definitely make I feel at home.If you're visiting for the first time let them know. Dress casual or fancy .... They're still hospitable !"
"Eh, don't believe the hype: for the $100 my wife and I spent, it was a real disappointment.The service was very good, and the various waiters were attentive; however, it doesn't make up for the bland, unseasoned and fatty steak my wife received, a steak we spent $46 on. For that kind of cash we expect to be blown away... so why is it that the steaks taste better and Texas Roadhouse and are half the cost? No way, never again."
"We went here for our 1 year Anniversary and had a WONDERFUL experience!This is definitely THE place to go for a really nice night out without completely busting your boyfriend's bank ;)   (being a girl is rough! hehe)Cons: They DO NOT take reservations, PREPARE TO WAIT.  We waited 1.5 hours for a table, BUT they do have a bar and complimentary fountain drinks, popcorn, chips and salsa in their waiting area (why not just turn this into part of the restaurant? I have no idea)  If you're here with people you actually like and enjoy talking to, this time will fly by right? ;)Pros:The salad bar is crazy good and has a ton of options- including cut up chunks of BACON and the best rolls and cinnamon butter of your life!  We ordered the baked brie as an appetizer- it was wonderful, but then again you can't mess up bake brie right?I ordered a glass of the Robert Mondavi Merlot, a 6 oz filet and the sautéed mushrooms = FOOD ORGASM.  My boyfriend, who is quite the steak guy, ordered the New York strip and mashed potatoes and loved it!Our waiter, who was very helpful in recommendations and gave us great service and was very friendly, had asked us if we were here for a special occasion and we told him that it was our anniversary!  He came out with a huge dessert tray and asked us to pick a dessert and that it would be on the house!  SO COOL!  We picked the cheesecake with raspberry sauce- it was delicious!Now for the BEST part of the Taste of Texas,  for a glass of wine, a beer, an appetizer, an unlimited salad bar, two steaks, two sides, complimentary waiting room snacks and a dessert = $109, which WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE at any other upscale steakhouse that I know of at least!We will definitely be back!!!"
"Wow after hearing all the stuff about this steakhouse, me and sis finally had the chance to visit the restaurant on a Sunday night. We arrived at the restaurant around 6:15pm, and there's already a line going on. The waitress greeted us and told us it will be a 35-45 minute wait, and of course we expected that already.The waiting area is at the side with chairs and tables, TV, drinks, popcorn and salsa available. If you want to wait outside, there are also benches and drinks available. We waited for ~35 minutes so I have to say it's not bad at all.The food was just awesome and you have a salad bar with dinner rolls/jalapeno corn bread available. My 20-ounce rib eye is cooked to a perfect medium well with little fat. My sister's salmon was also delicious, too bad she is not a fan for steaks. There is a large selections of wines if that's your thing. Yeah the price is on the high side, but nothing beats a great meal with great environment.BTW, there's free WiFi available for you while you wait too!!!"
"Me and my husband celebrated our 14th year wedding anniversary here. Jason our attendant is very attentive and has exceeded our expectations. Great selection of salad bar, great steak paired up with not so pricey wine + great service (couldn't get any better than that). Salute to Taste of Texas for making our occassion a memorable one."
"Well, where do I start? Well I want om here on 12/30/15 I don't usually go here because on how much it cost. But based on how very special the occasion is. So I got here around about 6. Had to wait close to 2 hours for a table of 5. When we got to our table. Boy, was I hungry.  Sat done got my drinks ordered, and attacked the salad bar. I had ordered the ribeye steak choiv d of oz. I had the 18 oz. And the baked sweet potato. Good enough to feel me up."
"Best steakhouse in Houston!!! Love love love this place!!! The salad bar is delicious, so much to choose from! The cheese bread is definitely the bread to try. Make sure you save room for the steak. Usually the waiter will offer you to pick out your own steak.. Do it!! It's a great experience because they actually take you in the back and you literally get to choose your lunch/ dinner!!  I like to get mine medium rare and oh my God it comes out amazing!!"
"Very busy. I was seated in the wine room, which was fine as I was by myself. There was a six top by me that were continually interrupted as a server would get a bottle. I would have asked to be moved, that would so ruin my experience. I ordered a dirty martini to start and a cab with my rib eye. It was correctly prepared. One of the cool features to this restaurant is that you can go to the kitchen to select your steak. It's a neat process. Tons of people come here and it gets even busier as the holidays approach. Nice service and good food. You did it right TOT."
"Taste of Texas is good for what it is: a Texas style steakhouse. The quality isn't terrific when compared against some of the higher-end steakhouses IMO. The meat is delicious, but how hard is it to enjoy a giant fllet covered in garlic butter and lump crab meat? The salad bar is fantastic because you can gorge yourself prior to getting your fat steak. As far as ambiance is concerned, it is decent. Texas themed through and through. I will go back for business lunches, but probably won't choose to return on my own accord."
"I usually don't drive 45 minutes just for a lunch.  My sister insisted that I should try this place.  We went there yesterday. It turned out to be a wonderful experience for me.  I had Jumbo Grilled Shrimp served over wild rice with grilled vegetables and a trip to the salad bar. I enjoyed the lunch very much.  After we finished eating, the manager came and asked how much we liked the food.  Great food, great service and great environment."
"I used to eat in here a lot and I used to think it was five stars.  However, the last couple of times, I ate in there, it just wasn't as good.  However, they do have some great steaks.  They come out sizzling hot and most of the time, they are cooked to perfection, tender and flavored well.  The salad bar and warm bread rack are amazing.  The wine list is good.  The menu has a lot of choices and most of the stuff on it is good.  And save room for dessert, because they have some great choices.  Go on your birthday, you get a free dessert.  It's a great place to take out-of-town clients for business dinners.  Now, the downsides... the parking is terrible.  They don't have enough spaces, so if you go at peak times, you'll have a hard time trying to find parking.  And you'll normally have to wait.  And the owners are big Conservative Republicans and they tend to promote their politics at the restaurant.  As someone who doesn't agree with them politically, I find it difficult to patronize them.  The male owner has a political radio show and has been outspoken against people who share my viewpoints, so I curtailed my visits there after finding out about this.  But, the food and service are good."
"First of all, OMG!!!! This is a new fave spot for me. Whenever I am in Houston, which is often, I will be dining here. I was so impressed with the whole experience! The best steak in the world is right there in Houston off Interstate 10 at Taste of Texas. The set up is nice. The service is professional and it is a tad fancy. Right up my alley. With the steaks, you can go to the back to visit with the butcher and pick out which one you want. I opted for the ribeye, which is my fave steak. You can also choose from a few blends of seasonings and tell them how you want yours prepared. They stick a number onto your steak so you will know it's the one you picked once it is delivered to your table. Very cool concept. The salad bar is state of the art and comes with your meal if you order a steak or entree. I was so impressed with the salad bar, the steak, the service, the energy in the place. Can't wait to go back. Also, their drink menu and wine list are on a tablet/Ipad-like device and you order your drinks electronically. Very cool. This is one of my fave places now!"
"After such good reviews, I decided to come here. This was not a mistake. The server was attentive and catered to our needs. My steak turned out great. I will save this place my next special occasion."
T-bone was really good. The bigger the steak the better. Filet mignon was also really good. Tender and flavorful. It all comes with a salad bar and a side. Mac and cheese is recommended.Save room for dessert!
"Half way thru meal, I was informed about the Nurenburg Rally aspect of recent revivification of this place....had enjoyed the Hike to Salad Bar dodging Excess Staff chatting each other up....found jalapeno cornbread fine....but once the RIGHTIST WING NUT leanings of clientele came to the fore....not much good happened after that.Prime Rib was seriously underwhelming- fatty without character-tough to the blade-coating derived from Wild Bird Mix?Ridiculously Deep Dish Pecan Pie was fine........escaped to Neutral Switzerland just in time."
Screaming children at almost every table and mostly large parties of loud people.  If you have children or really large groups and like an overtly Texas version of Steak & Ale... this place is for you!  For the same prices and better quality....there are smaller more intimate Steak Houses relatively close by.
"Such a nice experience here at the restaurant ""Taste of Texas."" You get to see and choose your steak before it's made. I tried the center filet cut and it was delicious and satisfying. Very friendly and professional staff too. I'd highly recommend this restaurant for who wants to experience the great time and stake."
"This is one of my mother-in-law's favorite restaurants and the place my husband took me on our first date. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a certain fondness for it, but I think that fondness has developed over time. The salad bar that comes with just about every meal is decent with a better selection of dressings than most restaurants. They have your standard ranch etc, but my favorite is the cilantro vinaigrette. On this visit my husband got the onion soup - it was HUGE! Lots of cheese and lots of onions. They said they had increased the height of their soup bowls because they tended to slosh around, but that with the increased size of bowl came an increased portion of soup.  So you are warned!The steaks have a good flavor and tenderness - closer to a Del Frisco's steak than Outback.  Everything was cooked consistently this time - we ordered medium and got medium - but there have been other times when it was a bit undercooked.  Of course, we all saved room for dessert. We have tried just about everything on the dessert menu and when we KNOW we are in the mood for a good dessert, then this is one place we set out for.  I love that their key lime pie is actually tart and not overly sweet like at most restaurants.This is a place you can take the family, including some of the older children (like 7+ yrs maybe).  Maybe it is the large ceiling and spacious dining room, but I never get annoyed with children in this restaurant.  The interior is cozy and reminds me of what might be found at a resort lodge more than a steakhouse off a busy freeway in Houston.  I find I don't have to be worried about bumping into other people when getting up from the table here, which is nice.  And last, the service here is great the majority of the time.  I have had a few poor waiters, but the majority have been attentive and friendly.  Our waitress yesterday, Mandy T, was a lot of fun and seemed to enjoy waiting on us as well."
"Here's your full report on ""A Taste of Texas"".Wait time for a table: A+ No waiting. Took us right in.Bar Selection: D Only 4 beers on tap and none of them any good.Salad Bar: C+ Not a large selection of items, but the cilantro vinegerette was very tasty.Steak selection: D Took us back to the ""butcher counter"" to pick our entree. All their steaks are vacuum packed in plastic. Not a fresh piece of mean to be found.Entree Appearance: A+ Meal looks great.Entree taste: D Lacking any flavor. Should rename the place to ""No Taste of Texas"" Sauteed Spinach was a little gritty....as if they hadn't washed all the sand off the leaves.Dessert: A- Very good, but didn't get much snickers flavor.Coffee: A+ Very nice large cup of coffee to finish off.Wait staff: A They did a good job of checking on us and keeping the water glasses full and the extra plates removed.Overall experience: C- Nothing special unfortunately. No plans to ever return."
"The ambiance is good, and our server was VERY good, so three stars. I had the Tomahawk ribeye which was stringy. I think maybe the regular ribeye is better. I grill FAR better ribeyes at home. Wife had the cold water lobster tails which were good but you can get them anywhere. The child really loved her bone-in filet mignon, but it was 54.00 so I'm glad she liked it.The steak fries were also very good.The knives are those big, heavy, serrated jobs you see at mid-level steakhouses. They didn't go we'll with my medium-rare, gristly ribeye, a sharp, non-serrated steak knife would have worked better for me.Not bad, per se, but not an out-of-this-worldy experience, either. We'll try some more steakhouses before we come back here, which will probably be, um, maybe never? I dunno."
Special place.  Excellent is the only word to describe it.  From food to drinks to service and overall atmosphere!
One of my favorite place for Steak!!!!!! The service is super. The staff are very nice. I like the all you can salad bar that they offer once you order the steak. This is a place where you want to come hungry because their steak is huge. I love it!!!
"Great  salad bar...with PECANS! Yum. I've  never seen tortilla chips, popcorn & sodas while you wait in the foyer."
"BEST SERVICE EVER.Our waiter was probably the nicest guy ever so it made up for the fact that we had to wait in line for over 90 minutes just to get in. I guess it's much easier to organize when they don't take reservations but it is a pain since you feel like you're waiting forever.As for the food, the Texas Onion Soup was ok and the salad bar is a good deal if you get it with the steak (not sure if it's worth getting alone) but I got the one that you can choose how many oz you like. 20oz + a salad + a soup + bread + drinks + desert was actually a pretty nice price for what we paid for.Our family went here for my little sister's birthday and I love it how she got a free desert and they took a picture for the whole family to be able to take home! Thumbs up for that idea. My dad however was super happy he got to take home the glass boot you get when you order the cinnamon dessert (it's the little things, I guess)Over all, this is a great place to go to if you're celebrating anything special but I don't know if I would want to wait that long for just a normal dinner."
"How in the world this place can compete with the heavy weights is beyond me.  The food is not bad, but for the price, you can go to some of the best steakhouses in Houston (Pappas, V&As, Flemings...).  I guess the people that regularly eat here have not figured it out."
"Not only were the steaks and salads amazing, but the atmosphere and the service were superb! This place is huge but the ratio of waiters to tables was perfect! The waiters weren't overwhelmed with tables or going around in circles. I HIGHLY recommend!"
"The steaks, salad bar, and desserts taste great. It's a unique spin for a steak house.  The service is second to none.  The kitchen tour to select your meat is a nice touch."
"I've avidly used Yelp for several years already, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to rate a restaurant, which goes to say how impressed I was.Wanting to try a great steakhouse while in Houston, I found this place through Yelp. After reading the reviews, I expected a long wait for a Friday night, but it only turned out to be 35 minutes. This was probably just  luck, but still, it certainly helped give plus points.Service: All the employees, hosts, waiters, salad refillers, etc, were very friendly. My waiter, Ron or Ronald, made the effort to chat, was very attentive, and provided great service. I was sharing a steak with my parents, and he took the initiative to divide it up for us instead of having us do it ourselves. He also remembered that I preferred my steak on the fatty side and made sure to give me the fattier 1/3 of the steak.Food:The food itself was delicious. I am a meat-lover and even more a steak lover, and the cowboy steak I ordered was perfect. I also loved the salad/bread/fruit bar; how unique for a steakhouse! The complimentary snacks (popcorn, soda, and chips & salsa), that you could eat while waiting for a table, were a wonderful addition, too. Atmosphere:The atmosphere was just what I was looking for. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, but I loved that it also was laid back. After a full day of sightseeing, it was nice not having to go out of the way back to the hotel to switch into something dressy. Of course, you could dress up to go here and not look out of place as well. So versatile :)If I'm ever back in Houston, I would go back to this restaurant in a heartbeat."
"My family and I have been coming to taste of Texas for years.  The steaks are always incredible and everyone loves the salad bar.  This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion, bring guests, or just to have a great steak.  The sides are great and the dessert selection has something for everyone!  Taste of Texas never disappoints!"
"Appearance: Great environment for many occasions - dates, family/friend gatherings, business. Service: Of course the wait is the main downfall. But it's worth it if you have the time. They have popcorn/chips&salsa and soda to keep your wait pleasant, but don't fill up on that....After we were seated, I had a young college student waiter. Amazing, friendly, and quick customer service. Always had a genuine smile and had knew the food and wine menu well. Food: ToT is absolutely worth the $$$. You're going to spend $30-40 on the average steak (I've never had anything but the steaks here). A bottle of wine is about $40-50. Your steak comes with access to the Salad Bar - always fresh greens, copious amounts of toppings, fresh rolls w/ must-try cinnamon butter, and some fruit to boot.For my friend's FREE birthday dessert, he chose the pecan pie with blue bell cinnamon ice cream - not too sweet, the ice cream complimented the pie perfectly.My group size: 4 peopleWait time (Friday dinner): 45min - 1hrMy bill: (NY Strip +1/4 of a bottle of wine + tip): ~$70"
"This place probably has the best prime rib in Houston. Always consistent with this cut of meat. We love the fresh salad bar- huge selection of choices. You can even pick your cut of steak here.The wait is long, but they offer drinks and snacks to pass the time. I appreciate that! And if you have an out of town guest, especially outside of Texas, take them here!"
"My NEW favorite steak restaurant!!!! Before, we would go to Flemings for a nice steak dinner/celebration. This restaurant takes it to a different level for me! Celebrated my birthday dinner here last night. The server comped me a great snickers cheesecake, snapped a photo of me, & printed it out for me to bring home. As always, the manager (it was Michael last night) stopped by to check on the table.We were quoted an 1.5-2 hrs for a party of 10 on a Saturday night since they do not accept reservations. We ended up waiting less then an hour. There are free popcorn, chips & salsa, & sodas in the waiting room/seating area to accommodate the wait. We always order the Tomahawk steak and split it. The salad bar is the best I've had with lots of varieties & constantly filled. Blocks of cheese and sliced fruit are also available at the salad bar. The price is so reasonable here and the steaks are delicious!!"
"Taste of Texas is amazing. This was one of the first steakhouses I went to when I first moved to the area. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. They also have an amazing salad bar which provides many many many options which will allow you to make a Super Texas Salad; Big? Yes, Unhealthiest Salad you will probably ever make? Yes , Delicious Yes. I recommend anyone coming to Houston to try this."
"We have been coming here for over 20 years.  The food is fantastic as well as the wonderful salad bar.  The service is second to none.  On Friday and Saturday s you will have a wait, but they offer free soft drinks with chips& salsa to hold you over till you get your table.  The desserts are to die food."
We ate here as a celebration dinner for my new job.  I loved it.  We all loved it.  My fiancé and I both started with the salad bar which was fresh and crisp.  I had the 6oz filet wrapped in bacon and drizzled with blue cheese with the asparagus and hollandaise sauce.  My fiancé had the medallions with a broiled tomato with blue cheese on top.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious.  We were even admiring the food going to other tables such as the loaded baked potato as big as both of our heads and the Filet Oscar.  I wish I could remember our server's name because he was very good.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the pieces of art on the wall!  He was attentive without hovering.  I will definitely return to Taste of Texas and next time I'm going to do the option where you can pick out your own steak!P.S. We went on a Monday night around 5:30/6:00 pm.  We were able to get seated right away with no reservation but it was packed by 615/630 and many people waiting when we left as well.  I'm not sure what the reservation policy is but it'd be wise to call ahead.
"I LOVE this place. The salad bar is amazing. I would seriously come just for the salads here. The steaks are always perfectly cooked. The service is always pleasant. Only thing I would warned everyone is the lines on the weekends and holidays are absurd! I been in one of those lines for 2hours so I say from experience. Other than that, food and service here are great!"
Christmas time is the best time to come see all the beautiful decorations inside and themes in each room. Salad bar is amazing and includes fresh baked breads rolls And cornbreads. I don't recommend their chicken dishes-too dry but steaks- awesome!!
"I have no real complaints, it was just ""whatever.""  The service was very good.  Our waiter was knowledgable, friendly and helpful.The salad bar was pretty good.  Everything appeared fresh and there were some interesting items.  I accidentally dumped something on my plate (marinated veggies?) that were full of cilantro, which was my mistake as I find the taste of cilantro to fall somewhere between bath soap and b-hole.  Not your fault, ToT, that was all me.I strayed from my standard (filet) and ordered the T-Bone w/ garlic butter.  I would recommend getting the garlic butter in the future because I found the steak to just be kind of tasteless.  It wasn't bad.   It wasn't good.  It was whatever.  I also thought it was a little more done than medium rare, as I'd requested.  Ah well.  A  little salt and pepper and the aforementioned butter helped the situation.My SO ordered the ribeye which was more flavorful (duh - fats where it's at!)   The sauteed mushrooms were just sort of whatever as were his potatoes au gratin.  My loaded baked potato was on par with everything else.    Suggestion, ToT:  Put that garlic butter on those mushrooms and then let's talk.I'd planned on going out and dropping some $$$$ on grub on this night and kind of wished that I'd stuck with my gut and gone to Ruth's Chris or Vic & Anthony's or Striphouse or a million other places.  This place has been on my radar and while nothing was ""bad,"" for a $45 steak, I would like for something to be ""good."""
It's our family Resturant for over 20 years now. The  excellent service the great food and awesome service with the managers overseeing everything so close to ensure the best service. I adore you all in taste of texas
"I grew up in Houston and for years when it came time to pick my birthday dinner spot I chose Taste of Texas. Actually, all of the kids in my family did. I have been back a few times as an adult and it remains my favorite restaurant in the world.I will start this review with the drawback--Taste of Texas does not offer reservations and it is very popular, so you should expect a 30-60 minute wait during peak hours. Trust me, it's worth it. The ambiance is low-light, refined western. Once seated by the excellent waitstaff you will immediately have the opportunity to help yourself to the salad and bread bar, which I believe is gratis with your meal. I am a carb fanatic, so my first goal is to attempt to restrain myself from too much of the amazing jalapeno cornbread and hot rolls with the cinnamon and apple butters. After that, obviously Taste of Texas is known for their steak, and there's really no limit to the praise I would heap on the quality of the cuts and the skill of their chefs. If you still have room after that, the Texas Pecan Pie a la mode is a sure bet.I have been trying for years to find a steakhouse that can produce a steak that even approaches their quality with no success. If I knew when my last meal was coming, I would fly down to Houston and go to Taste of Texas."
"Terrible experience. Only came here because we got a $200 gift certificate from friends. Both native Houstonians, neither of us had been here in over 10 years. Now we remember why. Salad bar...totally underwhelming. Jason's deli puts this salad bar to shame. The addition of a couple of blueberries, strawberries, or nuts could perhaps move this salad bar forward to the 1990's. For the entrees. I ordered a small filet (6 ounces) rare to medium rare. At the small part was correct. Good thing i doubted the ability to judge temperature, because the steak was almost medium. My husband ordered a 14 ounce bone in filet medium rare. It was so raw by the bone that it was cold. He ate not even 1/2 of it. The server said she would tell the manager. We assumed that was why she disappeared for so long. But no. And the steak wasn't even discounted. No manager apologized. The only good thing about this meal is we can laugh about it later. And the $100 bottle of wine we bought. Which we already have at home at cost us $40."
"The best steak I ever had and I have been to a few steakhouses in Texas and back home in Palm Beach.  Great ambiance, phenomenal service and a great salad bar.  Had the NY Strip Steak which was cooked perfectly and enjoyed every single bite.  Will definitely come here again."
"This is my parent's favorite steak house, and they eat this stuff every other week. Why cant they go to Luby's like everyone else's parents?Steaks- Definition according to the Eeyore - Bible thick raw slabs harvested from fresh catch of bovinae. Should be aged, then marinated and served just well before to the point of heat exhaustion. Aka  ""well done"".For pre war rationing, where everything is scarce, this place would be the feast hall of kings and emperors. But in a over indulged, buffet driven post war expansion, any lump under an inch would not fall in to the ""Steak"" category. Especially in Texas.Food:NY Strip- My choice of cut but not size. And in this monolithic establishment, you get only about 3/4 inch thick, not aged, and no pre seasoning. I've seen steaks in local grocery that will make these billets look like a razor. Flemings and Perry's throw cuts like these in the dumpsters. B-Salad bar- Thats what the main meal eats, it's the feed for the lower chain(And Hippies)? This is a Meat House? CBack in the Hoover era, where a Chicken in every pot was the promise.  And apparently my parents has hung on to these ideals, along with sweater vests and tube tv's. So while I crave the variety of Luby's, at least it's quality time with the rents where everyone seems happy and content."
"One of my favorite steak houses in Houston!Their steaks are always well cooked and prime cuts! You are even able to select your own cut from their in-house butcher. Their waitstaff are always friendly and attentive and the decor inside is pleasant. They have an extensive wine selection to match their great steaks! They definitely charge a premium for their meals, but its definitely worth it! They also have one of the best salad bars I've ever come across!Perfect place to celebrate a special occasion, or if you just want a good well cooked steak!"
"Absolutely best steakhouse in Houston! My favorite place to stuff myself with a great meal for a great price.Atmosphere: A mixture of a classy and casual steakhouse. You can dress in shorts and a polo, or dress up in slacks and feel at home either way. Service: Great service every time.Food: Their salad bar is fresh and amazing. Stocked with a variety of fresh bread, and a even larger variety of salad toppings. Their spreads for the bread is to die for. There is also a fruit bar with the best tasting pineapples I've ever had in my life. The steaks are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, nothing much more to say about that. Be sure to add their garlic butter!They DON'T take reservations so come early or you'll be waiting over an hour. They do have a large waiting room with free drinks, popcorn, and chips. They also have a bar in the waiting room. Also come on your birthday for free dessert!Fun fact about Taste of Texas: They refuse to make a chain at a different location because they want ensure the best quality for their restaurant."
"I use to think that a steak was just a steak. I use to even claim to cook a better stake then I could buy, which was true for the average steakhouse, and then I ate at Taste Texas. I now understand what a true steakhouse should be.You will have to get in line and wait behind the throngs of people who also enjoy this place, but it is well worth a decent wait. The complementary salad bar and the delicious sides make this my favorite all around steakhouse."
"this place is definitely for meat lovers! i love how you are able to choose your steak from a fresh selection, however i think it can be improved...image-wise. -Jalapeno Stuffed Shrimp: their best appetizer, the sauce is probably made with crack. i can eat it with anything! -Jumbo Lump Crab Cake: it was....okayyy. best one i had was still at Eddie V's (surprisingly) -Porterhouse Steak: get this medium-rare drenched in garlic butter and thank me later-Filet mignon: so tender so juicy! loved it!-Cowboy Steak: even at medium-rare..this cowboy was too dry for my taste-Chocolate cake: so deadly delicious!will be trying the the prime rib and tomahawk on my next visit and the awesome looking pecan pie!"
"Pros: Great Service & Wonderful Salad BarCons: Mediocre Steaks. When I'm paying  for prime steaks, I expect a little more."
"so I am a vegetarian reviewing a steak house lolWith that said if you eat steak, Taste of Texas has some of the best cuts of meat and the steaks are quite delicious!They also have a wonderful salad bar that has a great variety of fresh veggies. Definitely a place to eat if your visiting Houston and you are looking to satisfy your inner carnivore :)"
This place never ceases to amaze me. Their steaks are great and so is their 10 inch chocolate cake (order this if you are in a party of 4 or more). If you need your steaks to be medium rare then order for medium rare plus as I feel they under cook your order. You cannot go wrong by choosing TOT.
"This is an incredible steakhouse that my family and I have enjoyed eating at about an average of once/twice a year, since 1997.  The salad bar is always fresh with a great selection even including delicious breads, spreads and a couple cheeses.   The sides are always good too.  We usually get a baked potato or baked potato soup.   Most importantly their steaks are phenomenal.  They've gone up in price, but so has beef in general. I'm a ribeye fan myself.   I won't order a steak anywhere less than a place like T of T.  Always good quality, good cuts, and grilled just the way I like it.  If we had more money I would come more often; but Taste of Texas is a special occasion indulgence to us.  It's a guaranteed good meal and good experience, many other higher end places I feel like I am taking more of a risk at as far as quality for the price.  Also lots of Texas and cattle history here.  My daughter's class even got to take a very educational field trip to Taste of Texas (not during regular dining hours).  The owners are Texas proud and know their history.  Also the management, hostesses and servers are all friendly and professional."
"The Texas Standard for a city with hundreds of steakhouses. So what sets this place apart? First, their waiting area is superb - which is good for a place that does not take reservations and will not seat you until your full party is there. Free sodas, popcorn, and plenty of room while you wait = amazing. But the real reason this place is the best is the food. I normally get the porterhouse for two, which comes with a couple sides and their tremendous salad bar. The greens are fresh and they have warm bread with cinnamon honey butter. You can get your steaks with garlic butter - my favorite - or lemon pepper and you can even pick out your own steak! By far the best steak I've had in Houston."
Absolutely one of the best steak dinners I've ever had. Superb service and awesome food. No complaints and would highly recommend.
"For starters, try the quail bites - they are incredible.  Pick any size filet and you will be pleased and you likely won't need a steak knife.  The desserts are HUGE and amazing.  There is something for everyone here.What makes this place special is all of the history.  While you are waiting for your order, take some time and explore all the artifacts on the wall.  Make sure to check in with the host to a guide before taking the walking tour."
"It's official...I give this place 5 stars and I will send all my friends here when they are looking for some bada55 Prime Rib and excellent service.  Love it!My SO and I went here for my birthday dinner.  We had the crab cake appetizer to share since we knew we were going to pig out on beef!  I had the prime rib and the hun got the ribeye.  The waiter asked if we wanted to head back to the kitchen to pick out the ribeye, but we were like, ""No thanks, I'll let the chef do his job...I trust you guys.""We went to the salad bar and enjoyed all the fresh veggies and deliciously decadent breads.Our entrees came out and everything was cooked perfectly medium rare to both of our liking.  We shared a bit of everything and was able to save half of each cut of meat to enjoy the next day.  The waiter asked if we were out for a special occasion and we said it was my birthday AND I was craving some beef!At the end of the meal, homeboy comes out with a huge slice of pecan pie and vanilla ice cream.  You usually get cinnamon ice cream with the pecan pie, but my hun sneaked off and told the waiter I love my classic vanilla ice cream.They took a picture of me and my birthday pie.....not thinking anything of it...then before we left, our waiter came by with a cute TOT card with a picture of me cheesing over my pecan pie..hilarious!!  For a free pie, that thing was delicious...we couldn't even finish that big ol' slice.So I've been here for lunch and dinner...I conclude that everyone should check this place out."
"We went here for my boyfriend's cousin's birthday dinner. We didn't make a reservation thinking that it wouldn't be busy on a Tuesday night, but boy.. we were wrong! AND they don't take reservation =/When we arrived, which was around 7-8pm. We were told that they were on a 45 minuted wait.. what?? on a Tuesday night?? the restaurant was packed and the first thing in my head was, ""this place must be that good"".While waiting, we were told that they serve free drinks, chips and salsa, and pop corn on the waiting area. When we went to grab some snacks, I was actually pretty amaze how comfortable their waiting area was! I liked the fact that you can already snack on something and have some place comfortable to hang out while waiting for a table. When we were called, it was actually a lot faster than we were told. We were sat immediately and was greeted politely by our server. Food was great and the boyfriend loved his steak. I enjoyed my meal and so was the desert! A great steakhouse and it's awesome that you get to actually make your own salad too. No complains, and I had a wonderful experience dining in to Taste of Texas.Downside... they have no valet. My boyfriend was quite disappointed since it was a bit hard finding a parking spot. :P that's just because he's a spoiled brat :DI will definitely come back again!"
"BEST UNLIMITED SALAD BAR EVERRRRRRRRRRRR!!!   Definitely one of the highlights.  There are gargantuan blocks of cheese that you can shave off and there are no limits.  It comes with the best bread bar (several different kinds) and the best salad spread!  They have cuts of meat to choose from in the back of the restaurant on display and it pretty much looks like a butcher shop.  As you get seated, this is a special treat that they offer, so you can see where the steaks are housed.  New Yorks Strips, tenderloins, t-bones. porterhouses, rib eyes... I'm beginning to drool.  Their steaks are extremely tender even when they are well done!  Btw, let's say your not satisfied with the way your steak is cooked.  They will gladly take it back and recook your steak until you are completely satisfied.  No questions asked!  Be sure to cap the night off with dessert!  You're going to shell out a lot of $$$, but its worth it, especially for any special occasion!The owner has his staff trained well when it comes to top of the line customer service.  They treat everyone like a king or queen."
"One of my favorite places for a special occasion, I really don't know what else to say that everyone else hasn't said!  Christmas decorations are beautiful this time of the year, atmosphere is very pleasant, and the service is excellent!  Be ready to wait on the weekends, but it's definitely worth it.  They have popcorn and chips and salsa available in the bar to snack on, but don't fill up, you'll definitely want to leave room for the awesome salad bar and of course, your steak!"
"The ambiance, the refreshments while you wait and the nobody's more important than the next guest approach is inviting in this ""everyone's somebody"" day and age. The food is top notch as is the service and so reasonably priced that sometimes I question going elsewhere for steak."
Great place to take out of town visitors for the ambiance .  However better steaks can be had at many other places.
"Believe the hype...this is a great place to enjoy a steak!!!Not only do they have a great salad bar, hot baked breads, and allow you to pick your own steak, but they provide free soft drinks and chips and salsa in their waiting room if you find yourself in the midst of a large crowd and you are ""on the list.""You can only make reservations if you have a party of 6 or larger. Expect to find large crowds on the weekends. My favorite steak is the Rib-Eye, cut to size at $2.00 per ounce (minimum 16 ounces). I always choose from the marbled side of the steak and cooked medium rare. If you can only take your friends to one place for a steak, then you have to go to Taste of Texas!!!"
In my humble opinion on of the best places to get a steak!  Meals are a little pricey but well worth it.  It is noisy and a little crowded at times.  But I always enjoy going there.  The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
"This place sets the standard for all steakhouses - in Texas and around the world. The Taste of Texas is a legend in Houston. I'm always a fan of the complimentary soft drinks in the waiting area,  not so much a fan of the wait however. Definitely try to make a reservation. I however never hesitate to wait seeming as the food is to die for and always a must stop every trip to Houston. The steaks are perfection and the breads are amazing. Their soft bread and cinnamon butter - to die for. Screw the carbs.Also, the rustic decor is awesome. Probably looks like President Bush's ranch house. They even have their own secret service looking agents who stalk the restaurant and coordinate a smooth dining experience. Nothing but the best in Texas!"
I love this place and hate this placeThe wait here is horrendous Please come way earlyWe came on a Friday at 5 pm and we came right in and had a blast. Now when we left the line was two hours long. Our waiter today was Johnny and he was excellent. Patient with us especially since we had kids. definitely get the filet mignon
"We had high expectations and were terribly disappointed.  Looking at the photos of the dining areas on line one cannot truly see that the interior of this restaurant is more of a barnyard or chuckwagon style.  There's nothing wrong with that all --  if the food is good and worthy of the prices.  An outdoor picnic table is just fine as long as the food is good!!  And here at the Taste of Texas unfortunately it is not.  We arrived at 6 pm to avoid the 2 hour wait and only had to wait 20 minutes in the barn style bar where popcorn, salsa and chips are complimentary.  Nice touch but would have preferred to be able to make a reservation.  The bone-in filet mignon ($56) was ordered medium rare and came to the table RARE...very RARE.  The sauted spinach was nothing special.  The crab cake was heavily laden with cheese and a total waste of crab meat.  The salad bar was impressive with many options available.  The sound level is quite loud making conversation difficult.  The restaurant was clean and service was efficient without being intrusive.While it appears to be a popular place, if you are looking for a really good PRIME BEEF steak and a nice ambiance while spending the same OR LESS money -- try Pappas Steakhouse, Vic & Anthony's or Ruth Chris."
"One of the Best Steakhouse's unique to Houston. I fell in love with this place the first time I came here. It has great food, reasonably priced, and a good atmosphere. I know many people have their preferences on steakhouse, but if you have a first timer to Houston, I think its a great option. People that want a Fancier atmosphere I wouldnt recommend it this location. This place has a great salad bar and this is definitely one of the things I enjoy most along with an excellent selection of desserts!"
"We went to Taste of Texas with my family and had a helluva time. While there are other options available (chicken, fish), this place is known for their steak so we all had different steaks (filet mignon, prime rib, New York strip) and they were all amazing! Our waiter offered for us to go pick out our own steaks from the butcher shop, but we decided to just trust his judgement. We also got to try a bunch of their different sides, including a baked potato, spinach, mushrooms and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was particularly good. Any main entree also comes with access to the GIANT salad bar. The selection provided is definitely solid and a great start to the meal. Be sure not to fill up on your salad though, because the steak sizes are HUGE! There is also a wise variety of desserts available but after our huge steaks and salad, we didn't have room for any of it (bummer!). This place is definitely really expensive (about 50 per person), but it's a worthwhile splurge once in a while."
"Great food, great service, beautiful place!! I love eating here. Great for special occasions."
"Everything here is wonderful! The wait is long, but very tolerable; walk in, put your name on the list, and find seating in a SEATED waiting area. Enjoy complimentary sodas, chips/salsa, and popcorn while you wait! Time will fly by! Honestly, the best part about this place is the salad bar; cheese, cornbread, rolls, and cactus salad dressing on my salad are a must. My only complaint is that the last time my family and I came here, we ordered the stuffed shrimp and as always, it was delicious. This time though, we were all extremely itchy after eating the meal...and none of us have known allergies to anything really, so I thought that was a bit iffy. As for dessert, you can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes or chocolate mousse. Pass on the creme brulee; it wasn't all that."
"This review could easily by a 4 or 5 star, but I actually had a problem with the service.  I will get to that in the end though.  The food was great.  There was a wait of about 30-45 minutes, but I was pleased that the waiting room had lots of room, self serve beverage, warm chips and thick salsa, and popcorn.  Topping that off there was free wifi.  It didn't feel like it took long to get seated.I'm a meat person, but I really liked the salad bar.  It was simple but had the nicer items I like - i.e. sun dried tomatoes.  The balsamic vinegarette was a little thick, but mix that with mushrooms, cheese, red onion, and a spring mix and you have the typical salad served at weddings  The bread was soft and went really well with their cinnamon butter spread.I ordered the prime rib and it was delicious.  Bite for bite.  The crust was not over seasoned.  Juicy and delightful.  They will give you regular horseradish instead of just the cream if you ask for it.  The Texas Au Gratin Potatoes were a little too creamy/soggy for me, but it was ok.  In general, the sides seemed typical.So my only real problem - service.  I got a salad twice.  The 2nd time I got my salad, I had to ask my server for cracked pepper.  I did not think I was rude in asking.  I think she just didn't see me get another serving. She replied - oh yeah, no problem - in a normal tone of voice, BUT she had this really bad scowl on her face.I could live with that, but here's what made the night really weird for me. I ate with 2 friends.  So while they went to get fruit at the end, I was looking for someone to flag down to give my credit card to pay for the entire meal.  A lady comes by, sees me and grabs my card. I tell her, ""Thanks. Please make sure the other people don't pay for this.""  Later the check comes, I see the total. My card isn't in there.  My friend pays for it, and I just smirk - thinking - hey, they were prob just checking the total and they'd run my card.  The bill comes back, and they ran my friend's card, but my card isn't in there.  I ask the waitress - umm, do you still have my card?  I thought I gave it to you to run.  She looked perplexed and said, ""No . . . you gave it to someone?""  I told her I thought it was her or someone that at least looked like her.  She said she's check with the other servers.  We wait 10 minutes, and she gets my card back to me and apologizes.  I didn't want to make a scene, buta) where is the communication with this team?b) what did that other lady think she was going to do with my card?c) why didn't a manager come out and explain/apologizeIf I was in real business meeting, do they realize how embarrassing that looks?a) looks like I didn't care to pay or take care of the situationb) you lost my card and it took a server 10 minutes to check with the different servers to find out?I know I sound like a jerk, but when i pay over $40 for my meal, and if you have managers in suits checking up at tables after the meal is served if everything is alright, I expect that service is one of the important pieces of this restaurant - what else are the guys in jackets getting paid to do? Walk around and ask questions without acting?Do I blame the guys in jackets? Nope.  But if you're wait staff, and there is a problem.  I think fixing it is a little more than just giving you your card back, and it does not leave a good feeling in me wondering what they did with my card.If there is a charge on there, hell will unleash itself.Usually, at pricier restaurants I expect to be able to relax more and for servers to be on their game.  You may need to be more directive and firm with your server here.  I hate having to come off as a jerk when I am at a restaurant.  I don't like to tell people that I need things ""drinks refilled, my credit card to be found.""  I didn't even have an opportunity for the server to hold on running my friend's card while they looked for mine so I could pay.I will be back for the food, but I will ask for another server if I see the same person.  I will probably kindly ask/get to know the floor manager while I am there next time so there are not any issues"
"Best steakhouse I have ever been to. Their steaks are certified angus beef (best of the best essentially). I got the new york strip, which was amazing, but I had the taste of the cowboy steak/ribeye and I feel like those were a little more tender and tasty! Also got a tour of the kitchen and it was one of the cleanest kitchens I've been to. Highly recommend going to at least once as it is definitely pricey. You get what you pay for though."
"I won't give an opinion on the steak since I am not a steak eater and there are plenty of reviews to read about the steak quality, etc. However, I will review the salad bar:PRO: Quality over quantity. Not as wide of a selection as Fogo BUT it is waaaay better, hence opening statement. A must try is the cilanro vinaigrette and the tomato and mozzarella salad mixture. Mmmmm. Cinnamon butter on the rolls is fantastic and the jalapeno cornbread has a soft sweet taste to it (I picked the jalapenos out and no, no lingering jalapeno taste). CON: WHY DO RESTAURANT STILL SERVE SALAD ON PLATES???? HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU MIX YOUR SALAD UP??? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. Really irritates me. Taste of Texas should look into getting deep salad bowls. So annoying when my lettuce leaves are falling off my plate while I am trying to mix everything together.I had to LOL when I asked the waiter about their flavored tea. His repsonse: ""We have a fine flavored tea that is specially made in Austin. It's called... Sweet Leaf."" Ok give me a break. Don't try to make it sound like it was imported from France. Good grief. I have a huge bottle of the Mint flavor at home that I bought from TARGET. Ridic. Snickers pie is a must for dessert. Delicious. Heavenly. Unhealthy as hell. But then again, it's a steakhouse!"
Their salad bar is *gorgeous* crab cake is love and their steak so good. The super plus for me when we went there on valentine's day was that they have sunflower everywhere!!!
"Love this place--my husband and I were there for the first time this week. We didn't have to wait very long to be seated since we went during the week. The food was great, we had the stuffed shrimp, New York strip and the pecan chicken (I think, I don't remember the name). What we were most impressed by was the service...our waiter was super attentive and very friendly. We had a great dinner--will definitely be back, soon I hope."
"My family and I were on holidays from Australia and were only in houston for a couple of days. We thought while we were in texas might as well try a steak house. We got to this establishment and were greeted and were taken to our tables. Our waitor Jason embodies customer service he was not over the top and was very approachable. Jason took our orders and also asked where we were from, now once Jason had learned we were here for a couple of days and he went and got us neckerchiefs and hats for us to have a photo in. After the photos he let us keep the neckerchiefs and the photos were printed out for us while we waited for our meals. Not only does this establishment have the best customer service i have ever recieved but the food was the best i and my family have ever tasted.The steak i ordered was cooked to perfection and dont get me started on the dessert.Thankyou to Jason for making our trip to your establishment a memorable one"
"Decided to give this restaurant a try for dinner actually it has been a very long time since I have dined here more 12 years to be precise.  Moving right along3 stars for service, minus 2 due to crowd and unsavory element.  I guess I'm a snob when it comes to steakhouses, Good points you get to visit their butcher shop and pick and choose your steak if you wish.  I went with Ribeye and it was cooked to my liking, salad bar was nice as well.  Bad points I expected too much I guess 12 years ago Houston did not have other great steakhouses like today, I figuredthey would roll with the times instead of letting people with FLIP FLOPS dine in what is considered above average dining.I am sorry to say I will not return."
Had the 10 oz center cut steak and the scallion potatoes. It was amazing. I got to pick the steak I will be eating that night! It also had an all you can eat salad bar!
"I've never been a huge red meat fan, now I'm addicted. The steaks (Bone-in filet is my favorite) here are so tender and flavorful. Ask for garlic butter if you don't want the filet oscar. The salad bar has a great variety of options and the breads are amazing. The mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes are also a fav."
"Always enjoy coming here. Steaks are fantastic! Salad bar is okay - bigger selection would be nice, but I won't complain. Since I changed my eating habits, I've also had grilled veggie plate here and grilled chicken, both fantastic. Great service - very attentive people. BUT, be sure to get here early or you will be waiting (not the end of the world - free non-alcoholic beverages and snacks)."
"The food here is not only fantastic but it's mega portions so you definitely get your money's worth. I've been here quite a few times and I have to say for each time it's been top notch. Epic prime rib, filet mignon and NY strip are served up here. Desserts are decadent and will put you in a blissful sugar daze. Another yelper noted that their ""done-ness"" in cooking your steak is a little off (good tip, btw) and it's true that every steak place will have their own idea of ""done-ness"". Just be really specific with them and you'll be satisfied. I like my steaks med-rare and my NY strips somewhat rare. So far they've done an A-ok job. The decor is very relaxing in a cozy romantic way. Seats are comfy and you can relax and enjoy the scenery while you wait for your  food. Depending on your time of arrival, wait time can be none to long. Yes, it can be a long wait but the waiting area is comfy and large enough so you don't feel overcrowded. This place also serves some of the best burgers. If you're wanting a good burger for lunch and are in the area then head on in and they'll fix you up. I say give this place a try if you haven't already. You'll be happy you did."
Amazing food will definitely go back.  I had the prime rib cooked to perfection with horseradish  Brussel sprouts with bacon jam were to die for. We also had the bacon wrapped  center cut filet which was amazingly tender. The salad bar is wonderful everything is so fresh and the hot bread is delicious. We also had the apple dumpling absolutely sinful!!!
"ribeye steak by 16oz is perfectly fine,jumbo lump crab cake is very tasty.fresh salad all u can eat"
"I haven't been back here in ages.  We visited a few weeks ago at a busy time...a Saturday night.  You can't make reservations and the wait is about an hour long.  I think the decor is not as nice as I remembered.  The customer service was ok.     I ordered the Tomahawk steak medium rare, and it blew me away.  The display was beautiful, and it tasted like perfection!  The salad and bread bar buffet was good as well. I have been to many upscale steakhouses, and I must say Taste of Texas is spot on when it comes to great taste and reasonably priced.  I will definitely revisit again with my family.  I know now not to come on a Saturday night at 8pm.  I can still taste the Tomahawk steak in my mouth.  Delicious!!!"
"Salad Bar: 4/5Texas Onion Soup: 4/5Porterhouse Steak: 4/5Cowboy Steak: 4/5 - This was a 24 oz. bone-in ribye.Slice of Heaven: 4/5Service: 5/5 - The service was top notch. All of the staff was very friendly. There was a waiting area w/ several tables & complimentary sodas, chips, & popcorn. There were also 2 bars where people could wait. It's nice that the restaurant had waiting customers in mind.Ambience: 4/5 - It's a steakhouse w/ a family atmostphere"
"My husband and I were looking for a good date night restaurant. We loved how they have free fountain drinks while you wait for your table. We loved the salad bar, the breads, ambience, the 16 oz. steak we shared, and the mac and cheese. Very lovely dinner. We hope to go back for more date nights!"
"It's one of the Houston's ""Bring Your Guest"" locations.  If your guest is international, tell your waiter so they can make your guest wear a bandana and cowboy hat.  They'll take your picture and you can post it on facebook!  lolThe steaks are good, but if you are serious about meat...check out the Tomahawk.  That is caveman dining!"
What a great place to come for any reason or a top celebration. We love it. The steaks are always cooked perfectly.
"You think eating steak is a game? You better think again my friend.Having only one location (that I know of), Taste of Texas is my favorite steak place to go in Houston. It may not be the best but definitely worth every dollar you spend there. The salad bar (which you can get by itself for around $9-$10) is all you can eat and the filet mignon, bacon wrapped, with salt and pepper butter is THE best.Come early my friends, because this place does NOT take reservations. The wait can get up to almost 2 hours. They have free chips and salsa, drinks, and popcorn when you wait. Also, during the holidays, they have a buy $100 get $25 free in gift cards. Definitely a great gift to give to loved ones."
"Food is great, blah blah. Just a note for an unprofessional service experience:Dinner was over and the waiter came with the check. We gave $100 cash for the meal ($65) and gave it to the waiter, who did see the money. His response was ""Thanks, I'll go get your change -- unless you don't need it"". I'm sorry, but if that was a joke, that is strikingly inappropriate in a restaurant such as this one."
"Oh my goshhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Sweet baby jesus this place is probably THE best place place I've eaten in Houston. Went here for birthday dinner (and because we had a giftcard) on a Wednesday night and was greeted by an overflowing parking lot and an hour wait. Really?? On a Wednesday night? It's not like this place is some teeny tiny restaurant, this place is huge and it's packed. Whatever. I'll wait. It's smells really good, I'm enjoying the atmosphere and quite honestly I'm intrigued by what is so special about a place that has an hour wait on a Wednesday night. Now, I'm not much of a steak eater...in fact I cannot remember the last time I ate (let alone ordered) a steak BUT the steaks here literally melt in your mouth. No joke. The best steak I think I've ever had. Not to mention, Taste of Texas, has a fantastic salad bar complete with delicious bread you help yourself to all before your cooked to perfection meal arrives. Now, if the meal alone isn't enough to dazzle you the service is equally as fantastic as the meal.I cannot say enough positive things about this place. Even if your not a steak eater, GO. Even if you look at the menu and think perhaps its a tinch on the pricy side, GO. Even if you have to wait an hour to be seated, GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! It's totally worth every penny you pay and every minute you wait."
"I brought my bf here for his first Texan steak (to prove that yes, Texas really is cooler than California). He (fittingly) got the Cowboy steak- 24 oz. of pure meatiness- and loved it. I, on the other hand, really enjoyed the salad bar like many other yelpers. My favorites were cheesy bread that looks like a cinnamon roll, jalapeno cheese cornbread where you can actually taste the pepper, cinnamon whipped cream, honey roasted almonds, and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Our waitress was so sweet and took us to the back to see the meats. She was also really patient with us while we took 30 mins just to pick out what we wanted. We came on a Thursday and the wait was around 30 mins. They have free wi-fi so time went by pretty quickly... The restaurant is so cozy and doesn't have that stuffy air that other steak houses have. I'm definitely coming back for the lump crab cake and desserts."
"For a first time visit, Taste of Texas was absolutely  disappointing. This establishment is most definitely overrated as for quality, pricing, and experience. Within our group of 5, I myself along with two others requested for our steaks to be prepared as medium while the other two requested medium well. When the steaks had arrived at our table, the inconsistency of how all our steaks were prepared was unacceptable. Some were well done while others had different shades of pink centers. Mind you that these were $40+ steaks prepared at a  highly reviewed steak house, and it was poorly executed to any degree. My $50 cowboy steak was so well done beyond medium, I insisted for another to be prepared. By the time it had arrived, the rest of the group had already completed their meal which completely ruin my experience dining as a  group dinner. Besides the garlic butter flavoring the dish, the steaks were bland as if there were no signs of aging or seasoning. Even Killen's steakhouse in Pearland can present a better tasting steak. The  management staff thought that offering me a free dessert would make everything right which I thought was completely insulting. For the management staff and those who brag great reviews about Taste of Texas, obviously you all have not experienced the best of both worlds with the high price tag that you're paying for. As a  major food critic who traveled and tasted great steaks from many destinations, Texas by far falls to the  bottom of the recommended list. Many steak houses within Chicago and New York city limits would definitely make you reconsider on bragging about Taste of Texas!"
"This is where you are driving for 12 hours looking to Yelp for help, aka ""yelp help"" to find the perfect place to relax and have the best steak ever in Houston. Our first time here, so glad we stopped! From our entrance to our exit, superb service. Everyone made us feel like we were special and allowed us the courtesy of taking our time. Drinks, salad bar to die for, steaks cooked to perfection. I had prime rib that was excellent and probably the best ever. Not over spiced or salted, very tender and tasty, also ordered at our table, the filet and New York Strip, perfectly finished. Dessert was Pecan pie.  Loved the suits running around the dining room making sure all is well! The sign of truly excellent customer service."
This is hands down the best steakhouse I have ever eaten at. The service is brilliant and the steaks are the best I've eaten. There is no place in the world that can beat a steak made from American Certified Black Angus Beef. The salad bar is also very great with some good selections. I recommend the quail bites for appetizer and the cowboy ribeye for steak. Best I've ever eaten. Also the filet is so tender you can nearly cut it with your fork.
First visit. We were impressed by the grounds. Ambience is quiet and causual. Love the decor as well. Excellent service. Our waitress Rebekah has excellent customer service. She explained everything to us. She was awsome.  Loved picking out my steak in the butcher area. When our steaks were served they were perfect. Thanks for a delightful experience.
"It's really hard to only give TofT 2 out of 5 stars but I couldn't honestly state it was ""A-OK. (3 stars)""  I regularly visit steakhouses in Houston and never experienced TofT until this weekend.  I was hesitant to try a new steakhouse just because there are so many that already have so much to offer.  When we came in I instantly realized this wasn't an upscale steakhouse like what we are used to.  In fact, I saw patrons in ball caps, hoodies, etc.  Most nice steakhouses wouldn't allow this--it was more like a group from Golden Corral.  Anyways, we were seated and had a nice server; again, the service doesn't compare to upscale restaurants (you'll understand shortly why I keep comparing them to upscale steakhouses).  The food was great, the wine prices were actually refreshing but the biggest issue came with their ribeye:  it's the price you'd pay at a 4-5 star restaurant but tastes something like you'd get at Golden Corral.  It was perfectly cut and perfectly grilled; however, it had ZERO flavor.  The manager mentioned that their steaks are ""supposed"" to be enjoyed with one of their sauces but, in my opinion, true steak lovers don't add ""garlic butter sauce"" on top of a steak.  The manager mentioned also that they don't season the steaks, only using the sauce.  This makes ZERO sense.  Anyways, when it was all said and done you're footed a bill that is comparable to the upscale steakhouses in Houston but you're paying for a Golden Corral atmosphere.  The service is not upscale, the food quality is good, the steaks are definitely not upscale but you're paying a premium.  I would prefer to dine at several different restaurants for the same price.  Two steaks, an appetizer and a decent bottle of wine came out to about $190 for the two of us.  I've never paid more than that at Pappas, Ruth's, Morton's, etc.  Did I mention it has a salad bar?  Another reason to compare it to Golden Corral. I'm always open to try new places but we definitely will not revisit TofT unless the prices decrease 15%-20%."
"The taste of Texas really means The Taste of Texas, came here early because I heard there's usually a line or wait so we came before they opened. They have refreshments outside for people the drink for free while waiting which is always a plus. When we went inside the atmosphere was amazing as we were greeted by almost every server inside. We ordered the ribeye and also a prime rib which included some yummy sides and also a visit to the salad bar. The salad bar was amazing as it had many different salads and additional a such as cheeses fruits, different breads and any other things. When our drinks was brought to us they bought a big vase full of soda for us to self pour which was pretty nice. The main meal came and it was just fantastic, meat was so tender and juicy def one of the better places in Houston to get steaks. All this plus the fantastic service provided by them they deserve 5 stars"
"No one does steak like Taste of Texas!!! It ROCKSSSS my socks off and then some :)This place is usually crowded during prime dining time and weekends. It's first come, first serve and no reservations are accepted. Not to worry though, they have a separate waiting area for you to sip on complimentary beverages (or buy some drinks at the bar), chips & salsa, & popcorn! Although snacking is tempting, try to refrain from it because you need your stomach empty so you can fill up on the MOST FLAVORFUL steak you've ever tasted! You can actually hand-pick your own steak (should you want to) and the servers are always helpful with their menu recommendations. Their salad bar is very fresh and I just can't get enough of their delicious warm bread!!!! (don't forget the specialty butters!)It is indeed steak heaven for all you carnivores out there!"
"Great service, awesome and fresh salad bar. Their steaks are delicious. I have tried their burger and it was just ok, I wouldnt order it again."
Not a classic Steak House but great meat cuts and good quality service. Decent wine list but you won't get that Classic Steakhouse feeling
This is my first time being to taste of Texas and definitely won't be my last. This place have great steak is so juicy and tender for the price is very reasonable.
"Love the steak and service! Had a fantastic dinner with cousins today. Love our dinner starting from the appetizer and bread!i ordered filet mignon for myself and cousins shared tomahawk steak and Ribeye! We all love it. Our awesome server, Danny, was friendly and attentive! He showed us around the ""raw meat zone"" and you got to choose your own steak! We were all too full to have dessert! Love it! Will go back for sure!"
"Okay where to start.. taste of Texas is a very appealing place the staff is very friendly, everyone speaks. So when we being seat I just love that about the restaurant.  Our waiter was excellent in explaining the menu, season and other pecks of the restaurant.  So when it came to ordering our steaks we decided to let her pick it. Okay so my steak was supposed to be medium well. No no no it was like totally uncook. Very tough not alot of season. But the mac and cheese 5*... then my husband steak supposed to be well done. Well it was pink. All the way.. uggggghhjhhh he hate to complain he's one those people that doesn't complain just pay and never go back.  But you know I was really disappointed because of the views and my coworkers opinion about how great it was., my experience wasn't at all."
"Hands down, my favorite restaurant. This is a great place to treat out-of-towners whether they are family, friends and it is especially great for business dinners as they have a good selection of wine and spirits. Taste of Texas does a great job of creating an atmosphere that can feel relaxed and upscale at the same time.I cannot say they serve the absolute ""best"" steaks in town (Sullivan's/Perry's, etc.) but they are very close.Huge waiting area with comp popcorn, chips and salsa and soft drinksSalad/Bread bar (included with meal, unbeatable)Steak served on sizzling plate with option of garlic butterGreat selection of desserts (go with snickers cheesecake and/or pecan pie)Consistently friendly staff (In 20 years, I have not experienced an unsatisfactory waiter)Décor filled with Texas historyRibeye is currently $2.35 an ounce, strip is $47.95. Not bad when you consider the comp waiting refreshments, salad bar and side are included.Do not look up any other steak restaurants, just go to the Taste of Texas."
"My dad normally gets gift cards to Taste of Texas every year from his company and usually we go as a family around Christmas time. Prior to going I had heard this place was pretty well known for their steaks and that they definitely do get busy.  The wait is definitely no joke, especially during holiday seasons but they make the wait bearable, offering an entire lounge area to hang out in with a full bar. Not to mention the free popcorn, chips and sodas that is at your service while you eagerly wait to be seated. I think their salad bar is one of my favorites as well. Fresh salad, a cheese cutting station and their bread selection is diverse. The cheesy bread and corn bread has to be my favorite and it's always fresh!I always get the Porter House Steak for two with my dad, but change my side between the mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries and steak fries. Taste of Texas is probably my favorite steak place. Their steaks are just the right amount of juicy and moist and absolutely flavorful.  So whatever hype they receive is completely warranted and justifiable. Staff is usually friendly and helpful, which will only make your dining experience worthwhile. I definitely recommend that you should at least give this place a try if you're ever in the mood for a good steak. They are pricey and a little fancy, but if you ever want to treat yourself out or want to celebrate any occasion, then Taste of Texas would be a fine choice."
"I have been coming here for years.  My parents always get their special during the holiday season where you can buy like 500 dollar gift certificates for 400.  Our family gets 2 of those a year or more.  We are seasoned vets of the menu and my personal favorites are the Rib eye with both spices, the baked brie with fruit.  The steak has great marbling and it is cooked just right, served on an iron slab that retains heat and juices.  The baked brie is in a puff pastry with pecan and honey glaze served with variety of fruits and crackers.  The salad bar which is included in the price of the steaks is all you can eat and some of the favorite items there are the jalepeno cornbread, the cinnamon butter where you can coat all the rolls with.  And an assortment of cheese and nuts to top your salads with.  The salad bar is high quality and truth be told, my parents are satisfied with just eating the salad bar.  However they usually just split the largest filet and get an extra order of salad bar.  This place is a classic, a must if you are from texas!"
Visited some friends in Houston and they took the wife and I there for dinner...fantastic. The orders ranged from T-bone to NY Strip to Filet Mignon. All were cooked perfectly. You can order steaks as big as 45 Oz here and all entrees come with a great salad bar and a couple of sides. Don't expect cheap prices here 'cause you won't find any. But the quality of the food is excellent and the service is wonderful.
"I've had their bone-in ribeye, boneless rib-eye, and porter house. All were fantastic. They wet-age their meat, which I believe to be inferior to dry-aging, but their steaks are still tasty. They cook them to the appropriate doneness. The salad bar is a nice compliment to the meal, and their desert selection is solid. The place is very TEXAS, in a very good almost over-the-top stereotypical way."
"Oh my gosh, yes. I like to meet my family here for our monthly dinners.  Everything at the salad bar is kept super cold, and the cactus dressing is to die for.  Incredible.  The food is always excellent, and if anything does come out incorrectly, they will replace it or fix in the error in no time.  The waiters are always attentive.  Like any great restaurant, you'll probably wait a little while for a table, but they have popcorn and a bar to hold you over. Casual / Dressy attire."
"Mediocre, buffet style (yuck!) For the price, I don't want to have to get up and go to the salad bar. Bring it to me!!I'll admit, the pecan pie is awesome, but I doubt it's homemade."
Had the 6oz filet and it was fabulous.  Salad bars usually freak me out but this one was great and I liked having 3 bread choices. Jalapeno cornbread was yummy. Very pricey and the decor reminds me of a cheaper buffet restaurant ( although they do have some cool authentic Texas memorabilia) but overall was a great experience.
"This place has the looks and ambience of a Luby's and for some reason is so busy that the wait is horrendous. The salad bar that everyone seems to rave about was so so, certainly nothing special and the New York Strip steaks had less taste than ones I've bought at Walmart. After 2 bites we were adding salt & pepper and looking for the steak sauce to try and add a bit of flavor. This place is ridiculously overpriced considering the food and atmosphere and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than my dogs who might get lucky with the amount of leftovers. Save your money, buy a charcoal grill, a couple of steaks from HEB, a jar of Emeril's steak rub and a bottle of decent red wine (at a 5th of the price), you'll have a much more enjoyable experience.Thanks Yelp for letting me get the bad experience of wasting a couple hundred bucks off my chest!"
"If love is what you seek then you'll undoubtedly find it after a quick visit to their salad bar. I absolutely LOVE the ginormous cheese block you get to help yourself to. Has a great southern/comfortable atmosphere. You're going to want to make reservations though, this place usually has a huge dinner crowd.Not a planner? Eh, no biggie - while you wait for a table you're treated to complimentary soda and popcorn (kudos Taste of Texas! This keeps your taste buds busy as well as the kiddos)Birthdays--they bring a complimentary dessert with a big ol' flaming sparkler on top! AND they snap a quick polaroid of you and put it in a lil paper frame as a keepsake :))Well done Taste of Texas, well done. (golf clap)"
"I have known about this steak house since I was in High School As I used to go with my family. I recently began visiting here again in the last couple of years. As it is on the expensive side , it is usually a special occasion when we visit. They have an awesome salad bar with breads fruits and different types of lettuces and greens., eggs, mushrooms, carrots etc. the croutons are also good they just need some kidney beans. I love that they have the salad plates cold. The least expensive steak is about $33. I usually chooses the rib eye. And ask for marbling in it for flavor. I let the cook choose my steak although u can choose your own if you wish. The Snickers chocolate dessert is also good which is one of your free choices if you r celebrating your birthday. Another choice is a smaller sample of 3 choices. The service has always been impeccable! Recently went with a larger group of 13 and it was just as prompt. They had several waiters bring out our food at one time to assist our main waiter. There is definitely no lack of manpower! The decor is also very Texas and sort of antiqueish. At Christmas time they have a nice wagon outside to takee pics at. Will have to return and add pics I took at a later time  by the way, I love the garlic butter on my ribeye. Recently, my dentist recommended to try the bone in ribeye....said the taste was really the best!"
The service was amazing. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and they took some photos and gave them to us as a gift and also gave us a free dessert. The meat was great but did not like that much the chicken. The salad bar was not that great but the bread was really good. The only bad thing is the waiting time as they do not accept reservations.
"Other than a corporate event, first time dining at Taste of Texas. Arrived 6:15 Saturday night, was given 60 to 90 minute wait time for 2. Very casual, many people dressed in shorts and flip flops. 65 minutes to table, no prob. Of note, same drink ordered at waiting bar was $11, $8.50 at table. Food was okay, steaks a little under seasoned. They tried to give us 2 soups and and a duplicate side, some confusion there. Salad bar was okay. Quite frankly it's little more than a fancy sizzler. So many better steakhouses around, Mo's, Vic and Anthony's, Perry's, Capital Grill, Fleming's, etc. Glad we went, see no reason to return."
Amazing service and wonderful staff. Could not ask for a better establishment to dine at. The food was mouth watering and I had the best steak of my life. I also suggest staying for dessert as well
"We celebrated my husband's birthday here and had mixed feelings. We were told that it would be a 1.5-2 hour wait so we were pleasantly surprised when only an hour had passed and our number was called. The popcorn and complimentary drinks were very hospitable! I really like that they are unabashedly Christian, but the music didn't seem to fit the environment...maybe some Texas western music would fit the ""Come and Take it!"" theme more. Our server was very friendly, but we felt that the service was slow. The food was fantastic--great salad bar and bread (especially the yummy butter!), amazing center cut fillet with garlic butter, really creamy mac and cheese, and the Slice of Heaven, which I had been waiting to try for ages was just as splendid as I was told it would be! Besides the slow service, our only other gripe was that we were asked three times if we were celebrating anything, but when our dessert was brought out, there were no sparkler or fuss made. My husband didn't mind, but we kept on seeing other tables with birthday sparklers and it was kind of a bummer!"
"We had not been here in quite a while. We felt like prime rib and remembered how good they are. Food and drinks were excellent. I used to go to the first location behind T&C mall. Plan on a little wait. Clean,attentive staff. Would not hesitate to recommend. Plan on a short wait to be seated."
The service was great and the food was delicious. We will be back for sure. The waiting area was extremely awesome.
Taste of Texas more like taste of $h!+. Walked in with 7 people to order a big meal. Hostesses was about to seat us and the old bald manger runs up informing my group that I was not able to sit down due to my Superman shirt. And that they have a strict dress code. I walked away with no problem then I watch them sit people in shorts and flip flops. Yet I am not the dress code. I am in Houston working the Something Wicked festival. Had some platinum selling artist with my group. Good way to turn away people who are now using there social media power to bash your spot. I was cool till we saw them seat other people dressed worse than my superman shirt he didn't like. Or in our minds he just didn't like my look. Which is fine. My money is just as green and the lady in flip flops you seated. Absolutely insane the way he acted towards me. Will be letting everyone I know to never show up here. Now we are at Long Horn Steak House where we were greeted and treated with respect. So if you plan on going here make sure not to where a super hero shirt. Didn't realize an Superman S was so unacceptable for Texas.
LOVED the steak but not so much the salad bar. I know this is a stake house but more options would be best.
Every steak I eat here is the best I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and melts in my mouth. The service is top notch and the pecan pie is to die for.
"Had the 6 oz filet that you can cut with a fork. The grilled portobello mushroom side dish was cooked to perfection. And say what you will about old school salad bars; I love the one at ToT. It rocks. Get there early because you will wait during peak hours. But waiting is cool too, as they have complimentary snacks and drinks plus a great bar."
"I ate here last week with my parents.  They flew in from California and wanted to get a ""Taste of Texas.""  So, I took them here.  I had never ate here prior but read several reviews.  The place looks like the what most people who arent from Texas might think all restaurants in Texas look like... very western.  But it has an upscale feel to it.  The food is very delicious.  I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye, Meduim.  Cooked to perfection.  I believe it was 24 oz. I couldn't finish.  The party consisted of my wife, me, and my two parents. Our bill was over $200 (my mom ordered two beers).  We went home and we all took a good hour long nap!A great place to eat occassionally.  Pretty pricey though."
Totally unexpected.  I figured this to be a chain type steakhouse. Not the case. Delicious!!! Nice cuts of certified angus and a very fresh salad bar. I will most certainly be back.
"I live this place... Great food, service and it is laid back... The only downside is they don't allow reservations and since the place is so popular there is usually a long wait."
"Got the Tomahawk ""medium rare"", baked potato and salad. Maybe it's their wet aging process or the lack of flavor but I did not enjoy it, it was rubbery and bland, I've had better steak at Golden Corral and the 38oz. claim includes the weight of the arm length bone. The baked potato was so depressing also but the salad, wow! The salad and cheese rolls definitely stand out. If i ever go back, it'll only be for the salad. Do yourself a favor and go to Saltgrass or Pappas Bros. I'll not be coming back here again unless I'm really craving salad and cheese rolls."
Cowboy bone in rib eye steak and keylime pie!!! Perfection every single time I have been here - southern style :)
"First time I visited was on my 30th birthday. I decided to go because of my party size and the reviews. I was NOT disappointed! Food is great! Salad bar is comparable to Fogo de Chao. The wait is a bit long but, well worth it! I don't care for Brie but, if you like Brie, you have to try their baked Brie!"
"I haven't been here in several years and if possible,  they've gotten BETTER!  We all ordered the filets and they were melt in your mouth wonderful.  Salad bar was always good but they somehow found room to improve it.   Needless to say, we all had ""happy"" plates when we left.   Thank you TASTE OF TEXAS for a wonderful meal. Decor was beautiful as always. Michael, our server was the best-even talked (just kidding) us into the house speciality,  cinnamon ice cream and it didn't disappoint. Don't know where we put it, but we put it away too!  TALK ABOUT GOOD- we  won't wait so long next time."
I'm not real sure what the hype is about this place. Steaks are not bad but they are not amazing like many reviewers say.  Place is way to busy for average steak.  I would rate Del friscos way above this place and the service is way better as well.
"I just visited Taste of Texas for the first time, and I was very impressed. The presentation, the amount of food, the quality and the taste were top notch. You can visit the meat case to choose your steak before it's cooked. They have an expansive salad and bread bar, too. I liked the cow trays the steaks were served on. The service was great, too. Our server was very knowledgeable and entertaining.Come early because the wait can be long. We waited about an hour, but it was worth the experience. The decor is very Texas-lodge."
"Great place for date night!!! Love the salad bar, and lot of choices from the drinks to the dessert.  And I didn't know they had a compliementry snack while waiting for your table. Awesome."
"First time to Taste of Taxes. The decoration and service was very great. We ordered Tomahawk. Garlic butter was not enough.  The beef was very great and huge, for sure. And since it was the first time, they would had a picture of you as a cow boy, which was quite fun. We were so full after finishing the Tomahawk ribeye that we did not try the dessert. Great place. Great food."
"Yeeeeeeiiiiiiiiii! My favorite  steakhouse for Ever :DThe salad bar, steaks,desserts, ambience,service... everything is just perfect."
"As a girl who was born and raised in Texas, I love steak. It's my favorite food and I can never turn it down. My boss brought us here for Administrative Professionals Day and I've never been happier to be part of the Administrative Professionals of America. After ordering, we started with the salad bar which is exactly what it sounds like.... on steroids. While you are at the salad bar, you can also stop off for some fresh bread that not only includes your basic rolls, but also jalapeno cornbread. AMAZING. Shortly after finishing our salads and more bread than I'd like to admit, my medium-rare center cut filet arrived on a piping hot platter that was shaped like a cow. It just doesn't get more Texan than that. To say I was in heaven would be an understatement. I tried my damned hardest not to inhale the tender filet, but my inner fat girl took over and it was gone soon after. The asparagus with hollandaise sauce was also delicious.Also noteworthy, obviously, is the rustic and southern decor. It had everything you'd expect to see in a restaurant called Taste of Texas. That's all I'm going to say because you just have to see it for yourself."
"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch today on my first visit. Wonderful burger, sides were amazing, don't miss the salad bar was the best! Can't say enough good things."
"I keep my reviews short and sweet, who wants to read a book when looking for a restaurant. Not me. Taste of Texas is the best steak I have had in town and I have had them all."
"There's a reason why people wait an hour for their table at Taste of Texas. (I don't believe that the restaurant even takes reservations--unless you maybe have a big group, but even then I'm not sure.) People don't come here because they're in a hurry, they come because they know they'll have a nice evening from the time they arrive until the time they waddle out. It's one of my favorite places in the world. Seriously. It's not snobby or pretentious and the food is always on point. I'm actually not much of a steak eater, but Taste of Texas has roped me in. I always get the 6-ounce fillet oscar, which comes topped with a crab cake and bearnaise sauce. (You can always request it wrapped in bacon, but my heart slows down, just thinking about that...) From what I can remember, most entrees come with a visit to the salad bar, too, and let me tell you--this is the grand daddy of salad bars. Remember those annoying sorority girls freshman year that always ate salad, because it was ""healthy,"" but they'd come back to the table with buckets of dressing and croutons and nary a leafy green in sight? That's totally me at Taste of Texas. There's too many tasty toppings to  get caught up in that whole lettuce thing.The salad setup isn't massive like Fogo de Chao or anything, but it's all about the details. Texas caviar, fresh vegetables, dressings and at the end, you get to pick up a basket of just-from-the-oven rolls with (drum roll please) CINNAMON BUUUUTTTTEEERRR! Seriously. I want to slather myself in it. Sidenote: Back by the dual salad bars... yes, there are two... guests can go into the kitchen's butcher shop and actually pick their own steaks. How's that for service? It's also evidence that they aren't hiding anything behind closed doors...Beyond the food, I've learned over the years, after talking with staff, how generous the owners are. Most of the servers are in school, so each semester Edd and Nina draw a couple of employees names at random and pay their tuition. I think they have to keep their GPA at a certain level or something, but apparently the owners tell the staff that they want this to be their last serving job, before they join the corporate world. They also offer history tours to the public and elementary school kids regularly to help pay for the tuition program. As a former server, I really respect that.If you want to experience a true local gem and have a steak to remember, you should definitely check it out."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Taste of Texas yet.  Good:For meatlovers: you will appreciate being able to choose your steak from a fresh selection of the best cuts of your choice.  You can chose your sauces, spices, anything you like to have your steak prepared to order.  It's quite impressive.The service:  outstanding.  No need goes unattended. We were celebrating a birthday - complimentary dessert and photo of your family (not cheesy).  The salad bar - for me (the vegetarian) this was the BEST.  The salad bar is something you will crave weeks after.  The selection is excellent and creative.  Bread and dressings all homemade and fresh.Tortilla soup - this is a meal in and of itself.  I did the ""soup and salad"" - i was stuffed.  The soup is delicious.Mac and Cheese side is rich, delicious, and not overly salty.  Collard greens - to die for.Bad:This place gets busy - make a reservation.Not a ton of stuff on the menu for veggie eaters - but boy, that salad bar is enough!In general, this is a special night out kind of place - its fabulous, filling, and a great way to experience a real Texas steak.  Everything is farm fresh and will not disappoint."
Great food and great service. Good wine list with a lot of variety in terms of price and variety. The ambience is cosy and friendly. Will be back
"I have been going here for close to 30 years. The beef is always excellent. The staff is attentive. The atmosphere is casual but upscale. I LOVE the salad bar. It is always beautiful and fresh. Their cheesy bread is to die for. The owners, the Hendees, are a great local family. They are active in the community and share generously through charity. The value at TOT is great, and even then, I feel good spending my money there. The only drawback is their no reservation policy. I understand it. But, will never wait 2 hours for a table. We usually time our visits mid-week, or exactly when they open the doors. Great for special family dinners and business meals alike."
"Best steak in Houston coupled with the best service in Texas.  I just don't eat there enough.  Thank you for working so hard on training your staff.  Seems like Taste of Texas makes an effort to hire students and veterans for waiter jobs, knowing that the are sometimes short-term employees.  Everything at this place is done RIGHT."
"Yet another former favorite that I've grown out of.. Growing up in the Houston area our third grade class took a field trip out to ToT to listen to stories about Texas history and have lunch, it was an awesome experience for an eight year old.. Coming back to ToT every once and awhile over the years it was a meal to look forward to, but in the last five years I honestly think I've just out grown the place.. The salad bar, apps and desserts are just boring and the Prime rib, while roasted well (as in perfectly) just doesn't have much going on to keep me interested. None of the other steaks are graded, other than labeled as ""Black Angus"", they however are never tough or tasteless. Prices are very affordable considering the location and the size of servings. Service has always been topnotch and welcoming and the wine list is very well priced, while offering wine flights now..   Overall take family and friends from out of town who have never been to a ""Texas Steakhouse"" before, but pass on ToT if you're looking for steak and potatoes prepared with a bit more finesse.FYI- ToT does NOT take reservations no matter how big or small the party. Wait times on the weekends for dinner will range from 45mins to an hour and a half.."
"Taste of Texas is the epitome of ""Everything is Bigger in Texas"". The restaurant is HUGE!!!! I believe there is over at least 50 people working there at a time. There is so much seating around the restaurant. I got lost trying to go to the bathroom. It's impressive how they maintain such a long wait even with a huge restaurant like this. They make your wait easier by offering complimentary popcorn in the waiting room.The food portions are HUGE! They have a 32 ounce porterhouse steak that they specifically have an option to share with another person. If you order some of the larger steaks you get to go to their ""butcher shop"" in the back and pick your own meat yourself. Most meals come with a trip to the salad bar which is you know the word - HUGE. Tons of options for you to go salad crazy and if you like cheese like me... a HUGE block of cheese to make you feel all tingly on the inside. There is also different breads you can get - a regular yeast roll and a jalapeno cornbread (amazing). There's also regular butter, honey, and cinnamon butter. Oh the options.You MUST get the steak if you come here. I ordered the tenderloin medallions which were good in their own right. It came with a blue cheese baked tomato which is fabulous. I wish I never tasted the bf's center filet. You get the option of lemon pepper or garlic butter on your steak (tip: get both!). The bf got both on his center filet and it tasted amazing. After 1 bite, I dropped my fork, demanded we split the dishes, and quickly regretted ordering my tenderloin medallions.Please grow a second stomach and reserve it for the desserts. There are again, so many options, all so tasty, you want to eat them all but can't since the portion is huge. The waiter brought a dessert platter over an I winced in pain. Just a few hours before, I was stuffing my face with not 1, not 2, but 3 desserts (a red velvet cake, creme brulee, and a napoleon from Hubble and Hudson). The agony! Should I really stuff my face again and eat enough sugar to last me for the entire week? Why not? I had a few bites of ""Slice of Heaven"" (possibly the best mousse I ever tasted) and a Snickers Pie. Amazing. Fantabulous.  Learn from my mistake. Bring a map to find the bathroom. Order steak. Don't eat 3 desserts before coming here."
"What I love the most about the Taste of Texas is that it is a restaurant that lives up to its name. All Texas. All taste!The salad bar might seem an odd thing to highlight about a steakhouse, but the salad bar at this restaurant is huge and full of variety. Make sure you hit it up.The steaks at Taste of Texas are phenomenal. Top quality, prepared to your liking. I enjoy my ribeye with either or both of the lemon or garlic butter sauces. The filet oscar (crab cake topping) is excellent and quickly becoming my new favorite.The appetizers and sides are plentiful and delicious. I've never had one that left me disappointed.The service at Taste of Texas is beyond the norm. I believe this flows down from a great example set by the owners. Last time I ate here my contact lens popped out of my eye. I didn't have any contact solution, but my waiter found some and I was able to put my contact lens back in and enjoy my meal.I enjoy other steak places in Houston, but Taste of Texas is my number one choice."
"This place is what makes Texas BIG. Monster cuts of steak - ""Yes, DO have a cow."" Modest-sized but tasty fresh salad bar - all the Texas touches are nice (to a Yank like me): awesome pecans, raisins, and cut-your-own-cheese from a wedge the size of a recliner. The Cowboy Steak was awesome, as was the prime rib. The baked potato was appropriately football-sized. I was hollerin', ""hee-haw"" until I saw the prices...EVERYTHING is big in Texas, including the cost of a lunch. Even fancy-shmancy steakhouses in Boston have a lower-cost lunch menu, but not if you want a Taste of Texas."
"I really have no complaints for Taste of Texas. Is it the absolute best restaurant in Houston? Well, no, it's not. However, I celebrated many family birthdays and graduations here, growing up. When I go back, it's with my Mom to have those memories. If you want to spend a lot for a decent steak, it's a good place to do that. Be ready to wait, or just go in on a Monday right at 5. I'd say since they expanded their hours during the week, the waits are really not that terrible."
"One of the best salad bars I've ever been to!!! Great selection, everything tasted so amazing and so fresh from the veggies/fruit right on down to the delicious viniagrettes -- i grabbed some creamy cactus number for my salad and boy was it finger-licking gooood. I think I'll come back here just for their salad bar (hey they have a salad bar as a meal option for $9.95!) ToT only gets 3 stars from me though b/c ultimately, this is a steak house, and so based on their offerings the steak was just okay to me...its your average decent-tasting steak but for me, it just blends into the masses of other mid-range steakhouses in Houston, but pricier. I'm sure the name alone brings in lots of out-of-towners...its definitely old-school ""Texan-themed"" inside (I'm told they even give Texas history tours around the restaurant) if you're looking for that kind of atmosphere, and not too picky about your steak, you'll have a decent enough dining experience. Out-of-towners, though, will definitely get a taste of Texas."
"After years of visiting steakhouses in and around Houston and Texas at large, we finally had opportunity to try Taste of Texas.  Many friends have indicated this is a 'must try' steakhouse. My wife had the filet (one of our staples we use as a benchmark) and I had the prime rib.  Sides were asparagus (excellent) and garlic mashed potatoes (meh).  The filet might have been pretty good, but it was drenched in a garlic butter that really skewed the taste.  We love garlic butter, but I should be able to taste the steak.  Presentation was excellent though.  I haven't had good luck with prime rib at steakhouses in Texas, but I thought I would give it a try since they claimed ""slow roasted"".  The prime rib itself was 'good', however, they used a (very) creamy and watered down horseradish as opposed to something with more real horseradish in it (pet peeve with prime rib). Additionally, the gravy didn't come across as being drippings, rather more like a prepared au jus.  Presentation was 'plop on plate' (not even served on toasted french bread).  Overall, it was ok and better than other prime rib experiences I've had in Texas (for whatever that is worth).  We probably should have tried more 'Texas' style cuts.Ambiance, decor and service are a draw as is the salad bar.  We both also enjoyed the jalapeno jelly and cream cheese on toast they serve at the table very much.  However, we have similar fare in our neck of the woods, so there is little need for us to drive down the freeway for a few minutes to Taste of Texas.  If you live nearby or are in the area, this might be a reasonable weekly or special occasion spot (although there is some hot competition in City Center)."
"Short and simple: Think sizzler with an upscale feel and done right.You get to literally choose your own cut of beef; They tag it from the minute it's cut from the huge slab all the way to the end where you find it on your table sizzling on a platter, cooked to your perfection.The meal also includes a salad bar everyone keeps raving about (hence the sizzler) which provides a wide variety to mix and match. One of my favorite parts of this restaurant is the giant block of cheese you get to shave yourself. White cheddar or American, along with your choice of bread, and your choice of preserve; You basically can't go wrong with that trio combination.Our server was most entertaining and knowledgeable in his scotch. Most importantly he was on point with his explanation of every dish we asked about. Every little detail explained painted perfection in the dish and the dish we ended up ordering turned out to be even more spectacular than already expected.Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood to treat yourself or others out to an upper scale steakhouse."
"I wasn't sure about this place since I didn't think they'd have a lot of vegetarian options.  I was right, but they do at least have one vegetarian option -- the salad bar/ with a baked potato (you'll have to ask for them to not place bacon on it).  The salad bar as many have said is really good.  Lots of options.  If you are new to Texas or have friends visiting, this would be a cool place to show others.  Highly reco the butter w/cinnamon flavor."
"After having moved from Houston 8 years ago I was thrilled to be invited to one of my favorite standbys for dinner tonight.  And they didn't let me down.Our waitress was a delight and the service was impeccable.  The salad bar, as I recall, was always outstanding and it didn't disappoint tonight.  I had forgotten about the bread.  Fresh.  Hot.  Bread.  With cinnamon butter that melts upon contact.  If I wasn't such a huge carnivore I could stop with the bread.Tonight I opted for 10 oz prime rib, medium rare, with broccoli.  The prime rib was outstanding and the broccoli fresh and perfectly cooked.  Two glasses of Lehman cabernet (Australia, $9.5 per glass) nicely rounded out my meal.My take on Taste of Texas has always been, and still remains:  you can't go wrong here.  While there are a few superior steak houses in Houston, Taste of Texas never fails to deliver on service, atmosphere, and value for dollar paid.  I highly recommend it."
"A very pleasant experience for my mom's birthday today! Oscar was our waiter and made she was treated like a queen! Our food was delicious, but the overall experience is what we are raving about! They let her pick any dessert for free, instead of just bringing a generic ""cheap"" dessert like most restaurants. They came over to the table with a camera while the little sparkler on top of her dessert of choice was still lit, took a nice picture and then printed it for us and delivered it in an envelop with the check. They even wrote ""happy birthday"" inside! The kind of dessert my husband ordered came with a special glass boot and Oscar brought us a clean one to take home, without us even asking. The manager visited our table to check on us, which is always nice. I saw him visiting most tables! So, so happy with everything. It's been a LONG time since I've been here and now it's safe to say we will definitely be back!"
"Great place to bring family and friends who are not from or have never been to Texas, as the food, style etc is about as close as you can get to an authentic Texan experience. Of course, a steak is the way to go (Including the superb salad bar), and make sure that you save room for dessert! My only gripe is that you can't book a table in advance, therefore, you can end up waiting well over an hour during busy periods. Although the complimentary popcorn, nachos and soda found in the bar helps the time pass by a lot quicker!"
"Salad bar, steaks and a special touch. My husband and I tried out Taste of Texas for our Anniversary and it was a Great Idea! Our server, Rebecca was Excellent!Even though our steaks were not completely done the first time, Rebecca took them back to the kitchen and they came back perfect!  The attention paid to us by all the staff was Outstanding.  There is a lot of teamwork going on at Taste of Texas.The portions were of good size, the salad bar was very nice, I liked the fact that a carafe of tea was placed at our table - nice touch! And, the dessert selection had a nice variety to it.Thanks again Taste of Texas for a Wonderful Anniversary Dinner!"
"First time at the restaurant with 23 people for a business dinner.   I ordered the ""cowboy"" rib-eye cooked medium.  The steak came out medium well to well done.  I though this was a steak house?  Service was very slow.  I ordered iced tea and waited 15 minutes before I saw a refill.   I had to flag down the server to explain the condition of the steak.  Overall, I was not impressed especially when all of my colleagues finished their meals and I was waiting for a new steak.  By the time the new steak came out, I simply asked for a to-go box.  What a disappointment for a business dinner."
It's almost not even worth a review: everyone knows its great!! We waited for almost an hour for a seat. I am not sure if they take reservations but I'd check before I went again. I got the fillet which was awesome but my friend got the hamburger and just loved it!It's a wonderful tastes place filled with lots of energy and lots of people.
"There's a block of cheese on the salad bar the size of my head. Checkmate.This place is yum, though always a little more crowded for my preference. Yeah, you will wait and when a restaurant plans for this by offering popcorn and drinks, you're not sure whether to be pleased with the planning or frustrated that they know there's a problem and that they need to expand or something (or yeah, reservations!). Go with yay and set expectations accordingly. Wonderful meats, wonderful sides. I won't lie and say it's the high end experience you get at Pappas Steaks or Houstons (you know, dim lighting) since it's all bright and lodgey (did I make that up?), but did I mention the block of cheese? Don't skip dessert either, you're missing out bigtime if you don't take the plunge"
"I've been waiting to try this place for the longest time and I finally got the chance too. I've heard many good things about taste of Texas so I was excited to try it out! When we got there we were told that there was going to be a wait which was fine. We waited I believe a hour? When we finally got seated the hostess I guess were confused because I guess whoever was running board told the hostess to seat us at a certain table but thy table was already sat.. Then she told me to wait another ten minutes while she finds me another table..which was fine, I guess. I just which they knew what the were doing but I guess they're in high school so I should expect that..when we finally got sat I was greeted almost immediately which was a plus but confusing because I had one guy greet me and tell me that my server was on the way and another guy ask for my drink order then another bring me my drink then FINALLY my actual server comes and greets me and takes my order. He explained how everything worked and how we could pick our meat which I thought was interesting. He asked if we would like him to show us to the meats and of course we said yes. But, when we said yes he looked kinda annoyed.. I guess he was in the weeds or something. But, he could've did a better job at hiding his attitude. Finally we came back from choosing our meats the server came back and informed us that one of the meats we chose was the last cut they had and that they had given it to another customer.. Ten minutes later the manager apologizes for running out of the piece of steak that we ordered. Which I thought was nice.. We ended up ordering the center cut filet and the bone in filet. We ended up enjoying both since we had the butter to accompany the steaks. Our server was okay he wasn't very attentive and he had kinda of an attitude. I would return only if I had a different server and the hostess got the shi* together."
I have been coming here for years.  I've never had something I didn't like and I love that you can pick your own steak!!  How cool is that!  I LOVE the homemade breads and salad bar.  The blocks of cheese are SO good with the homemade bread.  The quail bites are YUMMY!!  The service is FANTASTIC!  You can not go wrong dining here. It's a great restaurant to take out of town guests to!
"We ate at Taste of Texas for our anniversary tonight and we thought it was okay.  Spending $170 for just ""okay"", though, is a bit much.  Fortunately, we got there at 5:00 before the evening rush and the legendary 2 hour long wait for a table began, and were seated immediately.  The service was fine, the restaurant was clean.  The salad bar was small and okay, the Texas caviar was a cute addition, we did like the variety of rolls that you could put in a basket yourself and bring to your table.   When we ordered our steaks they asked if we wanted to choose them, which was a cute gimmick, so we did.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms appetizer, which wasn't very good, we didn't finish it.  My husband ordered the NY Strip and a side of spinach, both of which he said were average.  I ordered the filet which was better than the NY Strip, they gave me garlic butter to melt on it which elevated the steak to good (which isn't a huge compliment since your steak should be able to stand alone as the star of the show...particularly when it costs $50 by itself).   My side item was the potatoes au gratin...those were delicious.  For dessert, my husband had the ice cream milk shake thing in the souvenir glass which was basically ice cream covered in what tasted like a pound of cinnamon...we couldn't finish it.  I had the snickers pie which, again, was okay, and we didn't finish it.  So, all in all, my review is...eh, I've had better.  And for $170 I've had a LOT better."
The best steakhouse in all of Houston. Conservative Christian family provides a wonderful atmosphere good pricing excellent meals and the service is impeccable.  Many of their Staff have been there for many many years.  They are family centered I cannot recommend any place better to take out-of-town guest.
i ordered the cowboy steak..the taste wasnt that good..the portion was not big but HUGE..the salad bar was good..the staff were friendly too..CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!
"Went there today to celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary. My wife's center cut 6oz filet was great, I on the other had a horrible experience. My bone-in ribeye was cooked well done. I had asked medium. They took it back. 15 mins later (after my wife was done with her meal) my take 2 on the bone-in ribeye arrived. Cut into the steak and it was medium BUT with 0 seasoning!!! No salt no pepper not even the nice fat shine of a marbled steak cooked at the tight temperature. Took a bite and had to put it down. My home cooked rib-eyes are much better. This was definitely no where near the quality of a $40 ribeye. The grilled vegetables were really tough. They comped the two desserts. My wife could not eat the creme brulee didn't taste like anything. I give then 2 stars because the service was good and they really tried to make it right. Also they have these annoying use of fire sparklers on top of desserts which burn up inside the restaurant constantly and stink up the place with the punching smell of burnt gunpowder."
"3rd attempt to go back there. Sick of their stupid and disrespectful ""no reservation"" policy. With my family for a once-a-year meal and it's a 2-hour wait (again.) Ridiculous. Won't be back. Ruined our evening. Makes no sense whatsoever."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  So far, this is my favorite steakhouse in Houston!  Other than the food (of course), my favorite part of the experience the laid-back ambiance.  Steakhouses of similar caliber (Pappa Bros, Mortons, Ruth Chris, etc) have a more ""formal"" feel.They don't have reservations, so if you go during peak hours, be ready for a wait.  Another nice thing, though, is that they provide free chips & salsa, popcorn, and fountain drinks while you wait."
"Taste of Texas is the best steakhouse in Houston hands down. You can't have a better beef quality than here and I stress on consistency. I dined at Morton's, Papas, Perry's and  loved them, but you can't ave the same thing done twice except at taste of texas. I always start with their out of this world crab cake. It is not your usual crispy crab cake. It is a mix of REAL LUMP CRAB meat and rich cheese cooked to perfection with a side of Remoulade dressing. Squeeze some lemon on it and spread some dressing on tip then dip the spoon into a soft and creamy crab cake. Filet is my favorite and make sure you mix both rubs to have a great tasting steak (lemon and pepper + garlic) Great wine selection if you fancy wine with your steak. One of my favorite restaurants in Houston."
"I ALWAYS look forward to eating dinner here. My family tends to come at an earlier time, most often before 5:30pm, so that we don't run into a huge crowd (and a long wait-list!) and we never come on a Friday or Saturday - I came once with a friend on a Friday evening for her birthday, and we ended up waiting an hour and a half for a table for two. Besides the occasionally long wait-time, the steak is CRAZY good. I am a 100% steak person (I'm a Texan all the way) and the Taste never disappoints. In fact, I'm positive that the Taste has the best filet mignon I've ever had. I always order the filet mignon, medium-well, with garlic butter on top (on a hot plate) and a baked potato on the side. The service is excellent for a constantly busy restaurant and the staff are always polite and helpful. The steak prices (because if you come to the Taste, you HAVE to eat steak) are pretty high, but definitely worth it. I never regret spending more than $40 on a steak here!"
"The place was just good all around!  Good service, good atmosphere & definitely good food!I'm just in town visiting my brother and he told me about the place.  Read up some Yelp reviews before we went, so we expected the 30-45 mins wait.  I'm from LA, so waiting for food is no biggie for me!  Plus you get free soft drinks, popcorns & chips and salsa while you wait!Well I have to be honest, I'm not a fan of steak.  But I had the salmon and it was absolutely delicious!  So for all the people out there like me, don't worry if you don't eat steak, there are more than steaks at the place!On the other hand, my brother LOVED his rib-eye steak, so for all the steak lovers no worries!!"
"I made a visit to Texas not awhile ago, and this place was recommended by a friend. The experience is truly amazing. We ordered a rib eyes, crab cakes, and apple cinnamon muffin. The steak cooked just perfect (mid-rare) and it is very flavorful and juicy. The crab cakes is just as great as the steak, it is made out the real crab, and it taste like how a real crab cakes should taste like. Then the climax of the lunch is the dessert. The muffin is just an wow in the mouth. Dispute of the good food, good price, complimentary appetizer,  and all-you-can-eat salad bar, Our waiter, Ryan, is truly great and friendly. He greets, chats, and really takes his time to serve the tables. Definitely a most attraction to me in Texas now."
"This is as good as a steakhouse in Houston gets! They let you pick out your steak, and tag it so you know you get the one you wanted, then cook it perfectly while you enjoy fresh bread and a good salad bar, but not too much or there won't be room for the steak and potatoes!"
"Excellent service and steaks. Steaks were cooked perfect, salad was fantastic, and the service was excellent. Best steak in Houston (if not Texas)."
"This is southern hospitality at its finest!  My husband and I arrived on a Thur night for dinner and waited about 40min for our table. If you arrive hungry, no problem. There's a complimentary bar with snacks and refreshments. For its size, I was expecting chaos, but it's the opposite.  Every employee has their job, and they do it well.   I was very impressed with how well-managed the restaurant was.  If you cross paths with an employee (which is often), they always greet you.  The food was good, but what made it great was the people.  We weren't celebrating a special occasion, but our server still created a wonderful experience for us.  He set the tone for the rest of the night.  It was my first time there.  Our server helped us pick out a steak in the butcher shop and gave us a tour through the kitchen.  From arrival to departure, we were there for almost 3 hours (past closing), and the server was always pleasant.  He was attentive and maintained a relaxed pace all night.  At most restaurants, you're rushed in, fed, and handed the check.  The evening at Taste of Texas was a nice change for us.  We had an opportunity to slow down and enjoy each other's company."
"Best Ribeye I've ever tasted. Salad bar excellent. Would have gotten a 5 star rating, BUT........the weekend 2 hour wait is ridiculous. No excuse to wait that long anywhere"
"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. Atmosphere is rustic (true Texas style) and laid back. They don't take reservations, but it sure is worth the wait! Their steaks are amazing. And yes, they do run a little high price wise (average $40-50 a steak), but it is well worth it. I know there's plenty of great steak houses in Houston, but I don't get service like what I do at Taste of Texas anywhere else. Staff is knowledgeable and attentive. And for those who are very particular about their steak, you can go to the butcher and select the cut that you want. Your meal also includes a salad bar and an assortment of bread. They have a cinnamon butter that just melts in your mouth and complements the food very well. This is the place to go if you just want to sit back and relax. It's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of life :)"
"After a long day of disappointments (mainly a terrible experience with Comcast costumer service) Eric and I decided to treat ourselves to something awesome!!I had never been to Taste of Texas on a Saturday night, and Eric had never been to taste of Texas before- so imagine our surprise when we get a 90 minute wait time!!! The most surprising thing for Eric though was the amount of people willing to wait for that amount of time.The wait time is easy when you have free popcorn, chips and salsa and complimentary beverages!!There is a bar on the wait area aaaand WIFI!!! They have big plasma screens- one had the Astros and the other had Nascar racing... so we decided to spend our hour and a half trying to ""ford the river"" playing Oregon trail on the iPad. Taste of Texas, I love you!"
"Taste of Texas is a pretty great steakhouse. For a steakhouse the ambiance is a bit dated these days, but I think that might be the reason I keep coming back. Prices are on par with most steakhouses and their menu is exactly what you would expect. They have a few appetizers which set the menu apart like the deep fried jalapeño stuffed shrimp and the crab stuffed mushrooms. The steak dishes are traditional to steakhouses and they also have a few fish and chicken options. My personal favorite is their Prime Rib, again it's a fairly traditional recipe but it's executed amazingly well. With your entree they include a fairly extensive salad bar with 3-4 awesome bread choices. They have a cilantro vinaigrette that I found quite tasty during my most recent visit. As far as bread choices go you will find a traditional buttered roll, A cheese stuffed roll that looks similar to what a cinnamon roll might look, traditional cornbread, and a tasty jalapeño cornbread. They offer a wide variety of desserts, and feature a cinnamon ice cream alcoholic shake.I definitely recommend stopping by and giving Taste of Texas a shot especially if you are an out of towner looking for a ""Texas"" experience."
"Years ago, when I was just out of school and coming to Houston a lot for training classes and other business, this was the place to go.  On expense account.  It was amazing, phenomenal, and over-the-top to someone fresh out of college and no longer enjoying the leisurely life of the recently-graduated-unemployed.  *sigh*  Good times.Fast forward a number of years and having had a number of culinary adventures and coming back here, I was a little disappointed.  I don't think the quality has slid, but others I have had just pass it by.What's the Taste of Texas experience?* Large, open, Texany (Texican? Texish? Texassy?  Help me out here) decorated room with a loud, busy vibe.* A decent salad bar with decent toppings.  A block of cheese that wouldn't fit into my MINI.  Various breads including jalapeno cornbread (yum) and apple-cinamon butter.* A reasonably good cut of steak, tender and done to temperature.* Large selection of desserts that are fairly good.  And fairly large.It's kind of 3-star quality food relative to some of the top-notch steakhouses, but it occupies a much needed middle-ground between the more generic Outback/Saltgrass entry-level and the stratospherically (priced at least) of Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Smith & Wollensky, John Thomas.  You can easily get out of Taste of Texas for $30 (salad appetizer, side, steak) + booze.  About half of what you pay at the upscale places.So, price-wise it's at the top of it's niche and I'm pleased with the experience every time I go there.  Maybe it is sentimentality.  That's worth something."
"Cattle and southern hospitality. 10 oz center cut filet, grilled medium rare to mother freakin' perfection. People really wait around 2 hours to get a table here? I guess I can understand why now."
"#1 Steakhouse in Houston!!!#1 in service - they set the standard!  Friendly, attentive, but not uppity.  PROS - Salad bar is the best in Houston!  Plates are cold, salad is crisp, fresh rolls, fruit, and cheese also available.  Steak is tender, service (again) is unparalleled.  Texas artifacts make it a great and authentic experience.   Kids meals are excellent and the value is great.  Complimentary soft drinks, chips, popcorn while you wait are a nice touch.  Dessert selection is yummy!  Try the snickers cake!CONS - No reservations.  Expensive. $30+/steak, but that includes salad bar, so...  Dining staff are great, hosts, not as friendly.  They don't have that ""positive"" vibe that the servers have, but it's understandable.GREAT place to take out-of-towners!"
"I was forced to come eat here with my parents. It was their 32nd anniversary so I didn't want to intrude, but they said I was the ""product"" of their marriage...WTF? That's technically true...but still...""product?"" Where's the tag that says ""Made in America"" protruding from the back of my neck? Nevertheless, I, as a product, still enjoyed myself to a fantastic steak dinner. When I arrived, it wasn't particularly packed. They require your whole party to be present before you're seated, but that's not so big of an issue since they provide complimentary soft drinks and popcorn to ease the wait. I wish I knew this beforehand since the nicely stacked cans looked particularly enticing; I just didn't want to help myself to one if they turned out not to be. The decor and ambiance is western classy -- not like other more casual steak houses (viz. Texas Roadhouse). Dark wood furniture, framed antique western tools, and the deep meat aroma hints at the gastronomical experience that's about to ensue. Our waitress was extremely professional and attentive and suggested a perfect full bodied, spicy red wine to pair with our steaks. Complimentary salad bar comes with each meal! Who doesn't appreciate free stuff?! An extensive array of different high quality greens and salad toppings quells the meat monger desire for the main course. In addition to the already impressive salad bar, they offer a variety of freshly baked bread! JALAPENO corn bread, cheese rolls, and dinner rolls are free for the masses. I love this place already. I ordered the Cowboy Steak, a 24 oz. bone-in ribeye steak, medium rare, which is, by the way, the only legit way to eat a steak for it's seared on the outside and deep pink in the inside that releases that irresistible raw, deep meat flavor. In my humble opinion, I feel the bone adds a little extra flavor to the meat and that the meat closer to the bone is more tender. What's unique about this place is that they allow you to choose your own individually vacuum packed Angus Beef steak from their butchery in the back. Taking full advantage of this, I chose the most marbled one of the group. More fat = more flavor; just make sure the fat is pretty evenly distributed around the steak and not bunched up in one clump. They'll stake a number in your steak for you to keep track of which one's your baby. When my steak arrived, it was still sizzling in the cow shaped metal plate with a dollop of garlic butter (*droooool*) on top. Perfectly cooked, the steak oozed with juices as I cut off my first bite and sent my taste buds swimming in a symphony of salty, beefy, garlicky flavors as it went in my mouth. Yes, I love steak with all my heart. As for the side dish of sauteed mushrooms, they were delicious too -- salty, herbally, and full of flavor. Since it was my parent's anniversary, we got a free dessert! How awesome is that? It was hard to decide from all their delicious choices, but they finally decided on the snickers cheesecake. The bottom was almost one inch thick of chocolate fudge that was layered with crushed snickers bar and then topped with a layer of cheesecake and a swirl of whipped cream. I was in sugary, chocolaty bliss before my sweet tooth died on me after the third bite. Though the dinner cost $240, the quality of their steaks, the amount of food, and the service is worth the expense. This place arguably served the best steak I've ever had. If it's a special occasion for you, come here for a memorable dinner and a free dessert. It's on me."
"Highest compliments to Taste of Texas for going above and beyond. I called the restaurant ahead of my parents arriving there to celebrate a special occasion, hoping to prepay their tab. The manager, Bill, kept his eye on them and made their visit completely memorable. Both my parents recall the service, the crab cake appetizer, the Porterhouse steak and the key lime pie being the best they've ever had in each category (service, crab cake, steak and key lime pie). Would have loved to celebrate with my parents personally, but hearing how well Taste of Texas treated them has really raised my perception of this steak house as the top in Houston."
This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. The steaks are delicious and the sides are too. The salad bar items are very high quality. It is absolutely scrumptious and includes unlimited homemade cheese rolls and jalapeño cornbread. The decor is almost a small museum of Texas memorabilia. I have eaten here for years and will continue to!! Ya'll go!!
"word of advice to management - do not give tours of your kitchen... if you have a cooler stacked with boxes of prepackaged individually portioned usda CHOICE steaks, its not gonna help you any with your customers... especially when u charge usda PRIME prices... no one wants to see their steak look like the ones at kroger...Hide your cooler... or take a trip to pappas and learn what a real dry aging room looks like."
"Pricey, but worth every dime!  Not your everyday run of the meal for sure!  the BEST steak and service in the industry!!!"
"I have to hide this from my husband because he was excited to take me to this restaurant and it was a total failboat for my birthday.  First off, I made the wrong choice and not ordered the steak.  I really wasn't in a steak mood that day and I really wish I was.  So on Monday, it was my 25th(yes, 25th) birthday and after a doctor's appointment, my husband decided to take me out for a nice lunch at Taste of Texas.  The place had very nice decor and what you would have imagined at a steakhouse.   We had a waiter named Geoff which bless his heart, he recommended the absolute worst french dip I have ever had but I will get back to that later.  He was a good sport and wonderful waiter so bad food does not negate his reputation as a waiter. On the table was a small serving of toasted bread and dip.  It was okay and a nice enter into trying the food of the restaurant.  As a starter, I had a chicken tortilla soup which came out rather quick.  This was very much the ""norm"" of tortilla soups but the flavor was good.  The thing that turned me off on this soup was there was so much cheese inside the soup, it coated my spoon in the yucky, weird cheese film so that every time you put your spoon in your mouth, it left a horrid amount of yuck on my spoon that I had to dip BACK into my soup.  Very much double dipping grossness here.  Entree: Poor Geoff recommended the French Dip sliders since I wasn't in a steak mood.  I ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.  When they came out, they meat was clammy as if my meal had been sitting out for a while.  Wasn't warm to the touch but just an odd lukewarm.  The au jus was warm but not enough to bring this meat to temp.  I had two bites and called it quits.  The garlic mashed potatoes were alright but nothing too fancy.  The Hollandaise  sauce was incredibly thick like Cheez Whiz before you microwave it or possibly pudding texture. I poked at it like a kid with brussel sprouts and I absolutely love asparagus.  It wasn't the greatest of sauces I have had.  For my birthday dessert, Geoff bought out a plate of pretties.  I went after the Deep Dish Pecan Pie and decided to take it home since I was a lil bummed from this experience on my birthday.  When I got home, I decided to try the pie and the filling was great and so was the pecan toppings. The only thing is they had a layer of what seemed like chocolate ganache  but it was made of pure sugar which overkilled the sweetness.  The pie didn't need that layer AT ALL.  It would have been perfect without it.  Overall, this place will forever stick out in my mind as the worst birthday meal ever.  I hope that others have a better time and better plate of food."
Visited in May 2013.  The saturday night we visited it was college graduation weekend and close to Mother's day so it was pretty busy. We were quoted 1.5 hour wait and it was right on. Not too bad of a wait as the bar has soft drinks and snacks. The service was excellent. Our waiter was a professional in every sense of the word.  The food was good but not great. In my opinion Saltgrass or Texas Land and Cattle have just as good steaks.
"Taste of Texas is one hell of a steakhouse. They've got other types of food but most people come here for the steak. It's definitely pricey but the quality of food is excelent. The salad/appetizer bar is pretty well stocked. I had the 16 oz. New York Strip with sauteed mushrooms and it was delicious. I ordered it medium and it was cooked pink throughout. Only a bit of outside fat to trim but it was very thick and far from dry. The mushrooms were also extremely delicious. I didn't have a dessert because I was stuffed but their offerings were almost impossible to turn down. The service is some of the best I've had. Very polite and personalized. Our server asked us our preferences when it came to taste and was more than willing to accomodate any changes to the dishes we decided to make. Overall, the quality and service is excellent but the price is a bit on the high side (only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me). I'd definitely recommend it though"
"Haven't been here in a good while. We split a 14oz ""bone-in filet"" because I knew I'd get full on the appatizer of bacon-wrapped quail, rolls, spicy cream cheese, cinnamon-honey butter and the side baked-sweet potato. The bacon wrapped quail was excellent. A couple were burnt but didn't detract too much from the flavor.I only had 1 roll with that awesome cinnamon-honey butter. That stuff rocks!So the filet. She wanted it ""medium"" and that's just a bit too bloody for me but oh well. Learned not to get the ""bone-in"" because so much meat stuck to the bone that you couldn't get off.  Asparagus and baked-sweet potato were our sides that were delicious.For desert, New York style cheesecake. Very smooth and very tasty!But honestly, if I want a steak, I think I'd rather go to steak-night at Red Lion Pub and save myself $80; the filets there are better, IMHO.2 drinks each + appatizer + steak + desert = $120"
The best filet mignon I've ever had to date! I want to go back to texas just for this restaurant! A bit pricey but definitely worth it!Food: 5Service: 5 Environment: 5Price: 4
I have come here everytime I've visited Houston.  The unlimited bread and salad bar are wonderful.  To be able to pick your cut of meat from the butcher's counter = amazing.  Just the portions and the quality of food is off the charts.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The chocolate cake really caps off the meal and puts you into a deep food coma.
"After having lunch here with my co-workers I wanted to share the experience with my husband. He is a STEAK and potatoes kind of guy. Everything was perfect. The service was great and the food was even better. The salad bar is the best I've had in any restaurant. The steak melted in my mouth and husband's cowboy cut was gianormous and cooked to perfection. The baked potatoes are huge but the grilled veggies were slightly skimpy. The four layer chocolate cake was the pièce de résistance. Of course, we had leftovers to take home. We went home totally satisfied."
"If you want the best stake in Houston this is the place, I have been there quite a few times and always the meat is cocked to perfection and tastes amazing, also the salad bar has a good selection"
"Best steak restaurant in Houston!  Impeccable service, great food, and good value.  Not to be missed, especially if you have out-of-town guests."
"Good salad bar, delicious sirloin steaks. Waiters are nice.. just a tad expensive for its real value. This is the kind of place you should bring your inlaws to impress.Old fashioned."
"The wait was horrible. Really bad. But it ended up being totally worthwhile. The hostess told us (a party of three) that our wait would be 60-75 minutes long. It did turn out to be about 75 minutes. The cool thing about the wait (if nothing else) is that Taste of Texas has bottles of water and soft drink set up around the wait area and people can just help themselves with drinks, chips and popcorn while they wait. Why can't all restaurants be like that?From the moment we went inside the service was excellent. Our waiter Dimitri was one of the best, if not THE best waiter I've ever had. Polite, professional, attentive and personal. And then the food was great too. We had some quail bites wrapped in bacon with a touch of jalapeno as appetizer. They were very tasty.All of our steaks were cooked to perfection the way we wanted them - medium rare. They were flavorful but not overly flavored with sauces or spices. My ""cowboy"" steak was awesome. Although the Hawaian ribeye at Houston's is still the best IMO. At Taste of Texas, you have the option of going into the ""butcher shop"" area to pick your piece of steak. I totally recommend doing that just for the experience. Dimitri showed us the cuts of the meat that we asked for, and showed us at least three slices of each of the meat. He explained the subtle differences between each of the pieces. And then we got to pick the exact piece of steak we wanted.The salad bar was also good. The veggies were fresh and the area was constantly being cleaned by the staff. I recommend the cilantro vignagrette dressing. The bread was self serve, and located in the salad bar area. There are three types of starch to pick from -- normal dinner roll, a cinammon bun look-a-like thing, and jalapeno cornbread. They were all freshly baked and tasty. And they tasted even better with the cinammon flavored butter spread.It was a very good experience in spite of the long wait. There are very few restaurants that are worth waiting for. This is one of them."
"First place i hit up once i moved to Texas... Steak was on point as it should be since this place prides itself on the way it raises its cattle and it even came with a # tag in it, BUT lacked big time on the sides.  it's as if they just didn't care about anything but the meat!Would go again but wasn't as impressed as i thought i would be...Wine list is extensive for you winos..."
"I don't live in Houston anymore, but every time I come home, I make sure I go to Taste of Texas. This place is AMAZING. First of all, the salad bar is delicious! It is fresh, great selection, and just awesome. This is complementary with your steak. Secondly, the bread is great as well! The jalapeno cornbread is so good! Of course the steak is so tender and delicious. I just had the porterhouse steak for two medium rare. It came out perfect! It is a place where I wish that I can redo that meal all over again. Not only the food is great, but the decor is pretty awesome as well. There is literally a ""Texas Museum"" inside of it. There are so many pictures, flags, relics, etc. around. It is definitely a neat place. They do not take reservations, which can be bad because it can be a pretty long wait on the weekends, but what is pretty awesome is that they have a room with free soda, chips and dip, nachos, and TVs while you wait. The waiting room itself is pretty great. Sometimes I just want to go there to watch the game. Soda, popcorn, chips and dip. Why not? Lastly, the service I have had there was always top notch. The atmosphere and the people working there is always relax and comfortable. The servers has always been super accommodating to us. You also get a free dessert on your birthday or anniversary. They even take a picture of you and give you a card with the picture in it. It is just little things like that, that will make you want to come back over and over again!"
We drove 45 min. to be told we'd have to wait outside in the rain for 1-1/2 hrs.!! I don't think so!! Boo!
"I took my girlfriend to Taste of Texas for a nice, fancy dinner and that's just what we got.The salad bar is good and well-stocked, but let's face it:  that's not why you're going to Taste of Texas, am I right?  My girlfriend and I debated our choices before settling on the ""porterhouse for two"".""Everything's bigger in Texas,"" they say.  Well, after seeing that porterhouse for two, I am here to tell you that it is absolutely true.  I can also safely say the same thing about price of the wine...and the bill, now that I think of it.There's no denying it; this is an expensive steakhouse.  Entrees are definitely pricey, but you get quite a lot for your money.  Taste of Texas, like the state itself, seems to take its steak as seriously as a heart attack (something hat a few meals there will definitely put you at risk of), to the point that they encourage people to pick out their own steak from their selection in the cold case.Everything was delicious, though I don't know how any couple could possibly finish one of those porterhouses.  But hey, you don't hear me complaining, do you?  I'd much rather get too much for my money than too little. If there's one big drawback to Taste of Texas' ""bigger is better"" approach, it's that our steak (boy, it's weird to have to say ""our steak""; a collective-plural adjective should rarely be next to a singular noun when it comes to entrees) was quite underdone.  We ordered it medium-rare and it came brown on the outside, but extremely rare beyond an eighth of an inch in.  Large steaks need to cook slower and longer than smaller ones and that steak could definitely have used several more minutes, so if you do order something large, be sure to order it at least medium-well.I suppose the size of the bill could be considered a drawback, but I knew what I was getting into when I walked in the door.  Overall, I liked it.  Just be sure to get your steaks a little more well-done than you normally would."
"moved here from dallas and my boyfriend and I are always looking for places to eat that are not too fancy but still have that nice service good quality food. so far this is my favorite restaurant so far!.. food was great, service was A+ . great place to celebrate birthdays or a good date with your love one."
"I come here a lot and it's all because of the food, service, & the amount of options they have. For starters, they have salsa and chips, popcorn, and sodas for free while waiting in line to be seated. Be prepared for a long wait on weekends and also Monday nights. Service varies from person to person have got a bad experience before. Salad bar is very delicious and to top it off the warm bread. Steak is delightful. Free desert on bdays! Perfect for date nights and special occasions!"
"I can't even begin to describe how much I love Taste of Texas. Their food is delicious, their service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is lovely. Granted, it is a very pricey restaurant, but if you ignore the price tag you'll have a great time and truly enjoy your meal. With your meal you have unlimited salad bar and bread (the cinnamon butter is to die for!) and that's enough to fill you up before your meal. Even though the prices are high, the quality and portion of the food is worth the money. The center cut filet is fantastic, and the baked potato side is huge! I've been here a few times with my family and we love it every time!"
"Over price restaurant, service not the best.   I felt that they did not appreciate the customer.  It was like they were doing you a favor by taking your order.   The food, not the best for the price.-----------------------Demasiado caro para el servicio y la calidad de la comida.  Senti que ellos no trataban al cliente con delicadeza.  La comida tampoco fue lo mejor por el precio que hay que pagar."
"The best place for all type of steaks, around $150.00 + for 2 depends on what you order, a little expensive, but worth it.  There's always a long ling during the weekend, no call in for reservations.  Even though you might have to wait for hours, there's a wait area with free snacks and drinks.  After you're number's been called, you are seated to your table, the waiter/waitress takes your order and shows you the way to the salad bar (an okay salad bar).  If you're new to the restaurant you get to wear a red bandana and a picture taken for you to take home (free).  If it's your birthday, you just have to tell the waiter/waitress and you get to pick a dessert of choice (free).  I would recomment this place.  Dresscode: Causal or formalPrice: around $60+ per person"
Been going HAPPILY  for years .. took a 4 year Hiatus- while living on East Coast and  when we returned..TOT  still held up to my expectations.. I LOVE the STRIP HOUSE downtown and it is a LOT closer to my house.... but my $ goes to TOT when we can get out 1-10 W to enjoy it! We usually go either early or late to dinner as the Wait can be brutal.. Easy to avoid if you adjust your time by 30 mins!
"Awesome Steakhouse. Had the Cowboy Steak, it was cooked perfectly, salad bar is top notch and the Cilantro Vinaigrette dressing is awesome.  Cant go wrong eating here!"
"I have spent my childhood and high school years in Texas, so I have experienced great Texas BBQ as well as steak.Despite what some people may write on Yelp, Taste of Texas is not one of those great steakhouses.I first have issues with that they do not take reservations and set up a waiting area with beverages and snacks. Granted, it is nice (and a little counterintuitive to the eating industry) to do this, but you could solve the wait issue by taking reservations (and a credit card to charge people who do not show up). For the prices they charge, I am surprised they do not take reservations. One lady who was a part of another party saw the waiting area and exclaimed, ""It's like a barn in here!"" Agreed. If you don't mind waiting and munching on carbs, then it's a good deal.Service here is friendly and well-intentioned but not so efficient. Our waiter was very kind (but a little loud, in a happy kind of way), but when you have 7 adults and 3 kids, efficiency is key at dinner time. We've come before because my dad loves all things steak, and he loves to spend time with the kids. The jury is out as to whether this is a good place for children.Salad bar is pretty good, and the breads and butters are delicious. The steak and meat, however...either you get steak that is raw or cooked bone dry. The kids hamburger which we requested as ""well done"" was scorched black. Every steak that was requested as ""medium well"" was rare. I had ordered the lobster tail, and it was essentially eating a seafood chew toy.The horrifying thing was after we had left the restaurant. My sister's ""medium well"" steak (which we discovered the next day in broad daylight to be rare) caused several unplanned trips to the bathroom and unpleasant indigestion. In the light of day (the restaurant is very dim), we were able to see the actual condition of all the ""medium well"" steaks.Now I am no chef, but I do know what ""medium well"" is supposed to look like - shouldn't a steak house that charges 30 dollars and up for its steak?I suppose I would have given Taste of Texas one more star if its prices were more like Outback's, but really given that we spent a pretty penny at the restaurant, meh, I've experienced better.Maybe it was a fluke. Texans looking for a good steak, I've experienced better."
"Summary: decent, but not for the money. If you're willing to spend this much you should be headed to a more standard steakhouse.There are two features here that people talk about: the steaks and the salad bar. The steaks are solid - par for the course, nothing to write home about. The fabled salad bar, on the other hand, is kind of underwhelming. They have lettuce, spinach, some dressings, copious amounts of bacon bits and other toppings, and some breads. None of these will knock your socks off.What really brings this place down is the atmosphere. I definitely value food over ambiance, but when you go to a steakhouse you're not just paying for some food - you're paying for an experience. The place just feels a bit white trash. There are many great restaurants with a white trash ambiance, but is that what you want in a steakhouse?"
"My dad lives in Houston, when my sister and I came to visit him in Texas, this was the place he took us when we arrived.  When my mom said we would be eating here, I wasn't sure if my sister and I would have to change... we just got off an airplane from California.  Upon arrival we saw people who were dressed worse than us, so we didn't feel that bad.  Since it was a Friday night, the restaurant was full, and from reading some of the other reviews, they don't take reservations.  This may be a long wait...  When we got there they gave us a number and we waited until our number was to be called or when it came up on the screen.  This is very high tech and organized if you ask me.  Well our number was 131 and the last number on the screen was 103.  The wait was not that long maybe 30 minutes.  We looked over the menu.  And the prices here compared to California were a lot lower.  My sister ordered a filet, my dad ordered the prime rib, and I got the Texas onion soup.  Our waiter, Joseph let us know that we can actually go to the back and pick the steak for our meal.  Just to explain a little more, note I said the steak and not the cow.  The steaks are portioned and you choose what is portioned out.  We also got the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer.  When you go to Texas, everything is huge in portion.  My Texas onion soup was about $5, but the size was two servings back in California.  The filet my sister got was very tender and seasoned well.  My dad's prime rib needed the au jus because by itself it was dry.  The shrimp cocktail was okay, nothing bad and nothing good.  Another good thing is that with your meal you get the salad bar, which you may need because of all the protein and starch you eat with your steak and potatoes.  At the end of the meal, they took a photo so we can remember the experience.  We definitely left not feeling hungry.The service here is pretty spot on.  You get the southern hospitality that is always here in this part of the country.  Next time, I'm in Houston this maybe a stop for dinner."
"I love this place!  I've been there three times now and never been disappointed.   In fact, each time I go back I like them even more. 1.  The food.  Their steak is always cooked exactly how you want it and the appetizers are delicious.  The salad bar is pretty darn awesome too!  You have variety and quality, and the veggies are fresh.  My mother-in-law mentioned that the salad bar and bread used to be even better.2.  The service.  The servers are friendly and attentive.3.  The ambience.  The Christmas decorations were adorable and really made the place feel warm and inviting.  Perfect for a casual night out with the family, or to impress out-of-town guests.One negative is that there is usually a long wait.  My family and I visited the day after Christmas and the wait was about an hour.  The waiting area inside was full so we were freezing our behinds in the cold for a bit.  There was a heat lamp, which helped.I will definitely be back."
"AMAZING! This was by far the best steak I have ever tasted.  Along with the great food, the service is is awesome.  Going on a Saturday night, the wait was about 45 minute to an hour in which they serve free soda and popcorn while you wait.  There is a bar area in back as well that you may indulge in.  The prices are expensive, but on the other hand it is worth every penny.  Our server Tyler was awesome and very knowledgeable.  Will be back again without a doubt!"
"Need to impress some out of towners? This is the place to go! Everything about this place oozes Texas culture, from the decor to the big and juicy steaks! They have one of the better salad bars in town, with a blocks of cheese you can slice from and your pick of  warm, soft bread.For steak they have all the cuts that you can imagine, but I always go for either the bone in filet or the prime ribs! Both are so juicy I am picturing myself there cutting into a steak right now!If you have a large party, I would avoid this place on the weekends as they don't take reservations and you could be waiting a LONG time!"
"Truly an experience. Food was hot and fresh. Prices are extremely fair. But, the reason for their success is service. Not one detail missed. We had a group of 11 for my mothers birthday. Service was outstanding"
"I attempted to give up red meat earlier this year and was successful thus far until I ate here last week with my boyfriend's family for his sister's birthday.  We actually came here 2 weeks prior for the dad's birthday and I ordered the Herb Marinated Grilled Chicken and sadly enough EVERYONE at the table found out and gave me a hard time.  Which I don't blame them, we did wait an hour and a half at a STEAK HOUSE and I oddly enough ordered chicken.  The chicken was tender and was an overall great dish.  But yes, even the waiter gave me the look like I was crazy. So fast forward to last Friday, I didn't want to be the weirdo again and fall into peer pressure (the things we do for love, right?) and ordered the T-Bone Steak.  20oz of filet and strip loin.  I hadn't eaten beef in well over 6 months+.  Unfortunately, I ordered it medium well and it came back super well done :(  So it had to be sent back along with my bf's cousin's t-bone which was also well well done.  The manager came out and apologized and we had 2 fresh t-bone as well as new sides to go along.  I had to take the steak off the steel plate so it wouldn't over cook it again.  But the texture and taste was spot on with the garlic butter.  The manager later gave us 4 free desserts.  Yes, 4 desserts for free to make up for the over cooked t-bones.  It's not bad...but for $37.95 for the t-bone, you'd think they would have gotten it right the first time.  So why did I give this place 4stars?  Simple.  Their salad and bread buffet.  YUMMY!  Unlimited fresh salad and their cheesy bread that stays warm in the oven.  DELISH!  Every time I go here, I load up at least 2 plates of salad and pack up to go on their cheese rolls.  Mmm.  Still have 3 in my refrigerator actually.  Aside from that one oppsies last Friday, they have the best service around.  Always greeting you.  Con would be the wait.  Every weekend, it's over an hour wait...you do get free soft drinks and chips/salsa in the waiting room.  The atmosphere is nice, the waiters are extremely courteous...and AWESOME CHEESE BREAD + SALAD BAR!  I've been here probably around 5 or 6 times and have had a wonderful experience each time."
"Awesome food.  Great experience.  I loved the salad bar.  Had many fresh options and also many different options for bread.The only thing I would caution you is that they try to UPSELL you on everything.  Add shrimp skewer, add sauce, add bacon wrapped, add sides, etc. etc.  The bill added up quickly.  Now I know exactly what to order for the next time and what to say no to.Great food though.  I ordered the filet Oscar (lump crab meat sauce on top) and it was good.  I was overstuffed at the end.  The desserts looked good but I couldn't swing it.  The steak melted in my mouth.  Yummy."
This place is soooo overrated man. The service is great here but in my opinion the steak just really isn't that good. In fact they try to cover up the lack of taste in their steaks by covering it with lemon pepper seasoning and cooking it in lemon garlic butter. A true steak should just have the flavor of the beef stand out and not be covered up by spices and seasoning. After having the filet mignon at Pappa Bros Steakhouse I seriously couldn't finish the one I ordered at Taste of Texas. It was overly seasoned and the flavor of the beef was just way inferior.Yes this place is packed alot of the time but so is the Aquarium and we all know how horrible that place is.
Ok we went on Saturday night at 7pm and was told 1-2 hours wait time. It took only about 45 minutes so not bad. The décor is nice and the place appears very clean. The staff were all super nice. I really did not have anything to complain about except lack of seasoning on the steaks (they are super huge) BUT this was nothing special when it come to a great steak. The salad bar was nice and the jalapeno cornbread and jelly were good and so were our sides but as far as steak goes I have had better (elsewhere and at home) and at $50  for most steaks on the menu a little pricey for not the best steak. All in all a fun night but not a $400.00 night for 5 people with only 1 bottle of inexpensive wine and no dessert. Also not a very good bar. I asked for a Manhattan with Jack Daniels Honey and they had NO flavored alcohols at all and they used cherry juice and bitters for my Manhattan! WHO does that? Anyway I guess its ok for out of town guest maybe but I won't be back.
Absolutely amazing!  The service and food was exceptional!  Make sure you are ready to eat because portions are Texas sized!
"High priced steaks, but they are good.  Blair B. has got it on the mark.  It's casual atmosphere with gourmet food... basically Texas in a nutshell.  The salad bar has nice cheese and choices of fresh breads.  The baked potato soup is great, and the fillet is one of the best I've ever had.  The Gold Burger use to be good, but last time I had one it was lacking.... but it's still the only thing under $10 on the menu.If you go on the weekends, expect to wait up to an hour at some points.  They do give you free popcorn and soda while you wait though.  It's a good place to bring someone to show them Texas steak.It's a good place to take someone but not the place you go to regularly.  There are plenty of other places to get a decent steak in this city.Random Fact:  Owner Edd Hendee is a big GOP supporter and can be found on KSEV talk radio. ksevradio.com/edd_hendee"
"You will have a long wait if you go on a Saturday night, but it is so worth it.  Great salad bar, Steaks are flavorful and tender, and dessert was to die for!!  They have a nice waiting area and provide drinks and snacks at no charge while you wait.  Great service and fantastic food."
"The food is excellent, the service even better. The atmosphere completes the package!"
Would always bring non-Texan friends there for a fun and nice dinner.
One of Houston's best!  Food is delicious and the service is great!  Prices are in line with the quality and amount of food that you get.  A true Texas experience that I highly recommend.
"I've never had better steak than Taste of Texas. I talk about it so much, I get Taste of Texas gift cards for Christmas. When you mention that they have a salad bar, it sounds (to me) less nice than it is. This isn't a salad bar, but rather a shrine to all things salad. The salad comes in at a close second to the steak, for me. Our favorites are: appetizer-Grilled Quail Skewer, meal - any of the filets, and my girlfriend loves the slice of heaven mouse cake for dessert."
"Their steaks were fantastic. Their salad bar was so filthy--it looked like a team of drunken paraplegics had been troughing away at it all night long. I was very dissapointed in my choice of having the salad bar as my meal. Everything was mixed together--chopped hard boiled eggs in the cloudy white tomatoes, all the dressings slung around into each other and all over everything else, the olives filled with chunks of everydamn thing into a sort of rancid looking soup..the prepared salads looked old like theyd been reused for a few days--I took one look at that salad bar and thought about just how filthy the line must be--and the walk-in must be straight out of Kitchen NIghtmares..However, the greens (that were on top...) were fresh and crisp and the huge chunks of cheese and excellent jalapeno cornbread were very, very good together..(which ended up being my meal..)The snickers pie was sooo.o.o good-- I highly recommend it. The table near us ordered a huge whole cake sized piece of chocolate cake--even I could have shared that one=)The service was very good and I mustve had my tea refilled every sip I took=) The manager came by and asked if everything was okay to which I replied that the salad bar was dirty and he handled it perfectly to me..he was so on top of it and polite I expected that it would have been wiped and cleaned a little--but no. Still a pig trough when I went for more jalapeno cornbread (it's his fault!!=)Obviously this place needs someone with balls enough to enforce some standards...And they need to be careful or someone is going to sue them over that big hunka cheese..I wonder how many people have had heart attacks in there=)?"
Was in Houston on business and went here on the suggestion of a local.  Amazing steak. That isn't why I'm writing the review.  It's been a couple of months since I was here and I find myself daydreaming about the pecan pie I had that night. I don't know where I can find anything that amazing in my neck of the woods and am fantasizing about flying back there to order one.
"Birthday celebration brought us here. As in other reviews, place was packed, does not take reservations. It took approximately 30 minutes to be seated. Husband and I split the 16 oz ribeye. Ordered it medium, it came well done. Sides were baked potato and asparagus. Salad bar comes with steaks. Even though the steak was over cooked, it had good flavor. $2.15 per oz with 16 oz minimum. The extra side of 4 asparagus was $3.99! $1.00 per spear is a little much. Other couple had the 6 oz filet and the sirloin. Filet was cooked correctly, sirloin was under cooked, but the waiter corrected with a smile. Birthday boy received free choice of dessert, apple pie. I had creme brûlée, and other two had snickers pie. All were very good, made in house. Waiter took picture of birthday boy and had it printed by end of dinner. Overall good experience, except for the incorrect cooking of steaks."
I love this place!! They have an awesome salad bar and wide selection of entrees. They add a little umph to their restaurant by letting you pick out your own steak in the back. I come here every year for my birthday. I just wish they opened earlier on the weekends.. and the only negative review is that you cannot make reservations for two people. I like to come here for my birthday with my boyfriend but I hate the wait.
"There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food, but if you're going to spend this much money, you might as well go down the street to Perry's!  Just didn't feel like I got my money's worth here."
Steak Paradise !  Great salad bar!    NUFF SAID
"Oh, Taste of Texas, how I love thee!  This is probably my favorite steakhouse in Houston.  For starters, I understand there is always a long, long wait when people come here, but who can deny free popcorn, chips & salsa, and soft drinks??  Once you do get seated and open the menu, you are absorbed in many different selections, but the best is definitely their steaks.  In my opinion, their bone-in filet is the best cut.  I have had many others (i.e. prime rib, center cut filet, cowboy, ribeye, etc), but the bone-in filet is a must try.  When you order their entrees, you get to go to the bottomless salad bar (best salad bar in Houston, by far!!), and a side order.  Another great thing about this place is that you can actually pick out the steak that you want them to cook for you.  They will give you this option if you choose to do so.As far as desserts go, I always choose the slice of heaven, and it definitely tastes like heaven!!  This is a dark and white chocolate mousse with a raspberry sauce on the side....probably the best dessert here!  I have also had their crème brulee and that is very delicious as well!  The service here is impeccable...their staff is very well trained and professional.  The décor is very cowboy-like, and being from Texas, we love that stuff!  If you have never been to this place, it's definitely a good place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, or any type of holiday or party."
I will be back.  I will be back.  I will  be back!
"This was a unique restaurant. It has a fine dining feel with a very laid back casual feel. The food was very tasty. When I went with some friends that had been there before, they said the deserts are usually better and are a hit or miss. I was shocked at the salad bar. The good quality ingredients made an excellent salad. I would recommend this restaurant to others and would like to return."
"If you're starving then you need to come here to eat because there is no way you leave hungry--- unless you hate the food but that's definitely not going to be a factor.This was my first time here and it was a great experience. First, the decor is fun. It reminds me of a wooden lodge in the middle of some forest. It has old guns, knives, and other artifacts. It's a big place and has very comfortable leather chairs... even in the dining area.The wait/paging system actually makes sense. They actually write the time you've arrived and the ""quote"" of when you'll be seated and give you a little card with that information and a number. I think all restaurants should do that.The food is so GOOD. There is an open salad bar if you wish to add that to your bill plus you get complimentary very fresh warm bread rolls and cornbread. And I'm talking fresh because they keep it in a warm fridge and you just go over to it and grab as many as you want. They have a good menu although if you're looking for seafood don't come here. They are crab cakes (which are the best I've ever had) and shrimp, but that's about it. You really want their steaks.And I need to mention that the staff are so cool and very friendly. My waitress was so attentive, gave great recommendations and actually looked like she enjoyed her job. We are so coming back here!!Oh the parking lot gets packed fast during prime time so just expect that little delay."
"Every time I visit Houston, my family knows to bring me here because it is my favorite restaurant in the city and my favorite steakhouse...anywhere.I have yet to find any place that can beat the filet mignon at Taste of Texas.  I've tried a little bit of other cuts as well, and they've all been delicious.  Everything is always cooked to order and having the option of adding bacon to your steak just makes it all better.In addition to the fabulous slices of cow, the bread rolls are great, the salad bar is fairly extensive for a steakhouse, the side dishes are hearty, and the desserts are very rich.  The entire meal is utterly and completely worth the price range and the shame of unbuttoning your pants afterward."
"The COW Bites!So I've been here a couple of times but none since I have joined yelp.  Well today I had the opportunity to come back.  First, this place has a waiting area full of complimentary beverages and popcorn.  Who else gives you free food while you wait?!?!  It makes the wait, even if a short one fly by.Now once we were seated the aweseomeness continued.  All of their entrees come with a complimentary salad bar.  So you expect it to be a pretty lame salad bar since it's free, but NO!  Taste of Texas delivers a mean salad bar.  The spinach was fresh, the toppings were plentiful, and fresh cheese is a must!!!A good steak place to me is defined by their filet.  Well this place outdoes itself.  They served Certified Angus Beef!!!  I always get my steaks medium, and this place served it perfect, brown on the outside with a pink center.  Now with their steaks they offer a free wrap of bacon, lemon pepper rub, or/and a sizzling garlic plate.The bacon is not necessary, but the lemon pepper and the hot garlic plate is a MUST.  It comes out on a metal plate in the shape of a cow.  When the waiter places down the hot plate, they give you a warning of ""the cow bites"".  These plates are scorching!!! The aroma that resonates from the steak is orgasmic.  As far as the sides go, the sweet potato fries were eh...the asparagus was meh also.  But the steak itself is worth the 5 stars.I was way too stuffed for dessert but they offer more than 9 delicious desserts from what I remember."
"My dad had decided that we would be going to Tokyo One for a family friend's graduation/get-together dinner. I found this offensive on many levels. I don't really feel like exploring the depths of my feelings on this, so I'll just say this: Japanese buffet. I also don't feel like explaining this, so, again: Japanese. Buffet. Fortunately, my dad decided upon providing other options--Taste of Texas and graduation boy's place of choice (despite my badgering, he didn't add in the obvious choice--my choice; so what if it's not my graduation, I have excellent taste). Graduation boy chose Taste of Texas.Thank my heavens above the wagon train! Taste of Texas is on the south side of I-10, just inside of Beltway-8. Google maps gives crappy directions, as, if you're going west, you should exit Gessner, not Wilcrest. The interior is a cross between a large log cabin and a steakhouse, with an open waiting area that had nice couches and chairs. I saw various people in polos, sneakers, and one fellow who had the winning combination of cargo khaki shorts and flip flops, and realized changing from jeans to a skirt on my way there was entirely unnecessary.Before your meal, small melba toasts are brought out with butter and jam. After ordering, you trek out to the salad bar, which has your greens and standard toppings, as well as some cheese for you to shave off (probably cheddar and parm), a salad of tiny mozzarella balls and grape tomatoes (I imagine this is so you can display it next to your steak so that it may seem larger), this awesome sweet, cinnamon sliced almonds topping, and the bread, which is in a heated...clear mini-fridge-looking thing. There's a mildly sweet roll, which goes great with the cinnamon butter, honey, and strawberry jam (the cinnamon butter is faaabulous); jalapeno cornbread, which is good, but cornbread isn't at its peak when sitting in a preheated...thing; and a cheesy roll, which looks like a domed cinnamon roll, and is nice in a mildly cheesy way, but can be a little too stiff up top (heated mini-fridge--damn you!).We had the crabcake ($14.95 to start), which is one crabcake about the size of a meaty athletic man's fist (3"" in diameter or so). It's nicely jumbo lump crab meaty, with a slight hint of cheese, but, eh, I still like getting more food to share before a meal. The bacon-wrapped quail (~$15 for 4 skewers) came with fried jalapeno poppers (the batter calls to mind panko). I bit into one, got a little bit of cream cheese, and stuffed the entire thing in my mouth, resulting in more cream cheese than I'd bargained for (which is often the case...). My 6oz center-cut filet ($31.95) was pretty disappointing. I'd ordered it medium rare, and it was somewhere between a medium and medium well. Even then, it had no flavor and wasn't particularly tender. I had high expectations for the 16oz. New York strip sirloin ($37.95), which were only mildly met. I actually much preferred the 24-oz. Cowboy steak, which as a ribeye, was more flavorful and tender. Though we were at a steakhouse, I actually liked the Texas pecan-crusted chicken breast, stuffed with herbed goat cheese, pecans, and onions ($17.95), as it was rather tender, and had that panko (or panko-esque) coating. The sides we got were forgettable: potatoes au gratin (all creamy cheese, no melty cheese), sauteed mushrooms (the mushrooms looked of the cold mushroom salad variety), asparagus with hollandaise (thick asparagus stalks, but the hollandaise wasn't anything to write home about), and sweet potato fries (average). For dessert, we had the Snickers pie/cheesecake/cake, which has a layer of cream, a buttery crust layer, cheesecake, a Snickers crust layer, then chocolate. I actually really liked the buttery crust layer, and a Snickers or peanuts lover should like this. We also got the ice cream in a boot (you get to keep the glass boot--or, rather, get a new one), which has cinnamon ice cream with Frangelico, amaretto, creme de cacao, and another liqueur (possibly Bailey's). Others in our party liked it, but I found the thin sweetness of those liqueurs wasn't balanced by the slightly icy-textured ice cream, which would've been better with a buttery texture.There was some confusion when the other servers were dropping off the food, but service was friendly. The level of service wasn't on par with that of a fine dining steakhouse, which isn't what Taste of Texas purports to be anyway. It's a casual place for steak, which is fun. Our server, when we were leaving, adopted the Trekkie salute, and said, ""Live long and prosper""--I was rather startled by that, and had to confirm that our party hadn't discussed Star Trek with him. However, if I have to pay steakhouse-level prices, I think I'd rather go to one with a less casual atmosphere. If I want a cheaper steak with a fun atmosphere, I'd just go to steak night at a bar."
"Definitely my favorite upscale steakhouse! Steaks are great, salad bar is good, I love the bread & cinnamon butter, desserts are good, & service excellent! There's usually a wait, but it's the only place I know of that gives you free drinks and popcorn or chips & salsa while you wait. And the wait is worth it every time! Prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for. My boyfriend and I usually split a steak since I can't eat much, then we just add on an extra side & salad bar. I've had wine and mixed drinks, all are good. We tried FOGO (the one in Dallas) and it didn't even compare. I would choose TOT every time! Love it!"
"yeppp prettttty amazing stuff here. i've heard so much about the BBQ and ribs in texas that i thought i was going to be disappointed since my expectations were set so high. nope - not the case at all. the food was aaaaaamaazing - everything from the meat, to the starches, to the sweets. i couldn't button my jeans or even breathe after, but it was nonetheless a great dining experience."
"I loved the decor but the customers were dressed down. The jalapeno cornbread was amazing. I really liked how a side order and a salad bar came with a steak, made it a complete meal."
"Taste of Texas...just OK.  Not the best steak by far....We have been there a few times...they do not take reservations, which is a problem if you have a big party with kids on a busy night.  They do have a room in the back where you can have sodas and chips while you are waiting, which is a nice thing...but the wait can be so long that by the time you get your table you are full on the chips :-( The staff is very friendly, the quality of the food is just ok....there is nothing extraordinary about it...the servings are texas size..I prefer quality over quantity!"
"Expensive? yes. Delicious? absolutely. There's something here for everyone. The salad bar is probably one of the best I've seen, with anything you'd want and delicious cheesy bread. Their spreads are also amazing and I wish I could take 'em home. Free drinks and popcorn while you wait outside adds a nice touch.Be ware that a bigger piece of meat may not cook easily to what your preferences are, so take that into consideration. Came here for a bachelor party and a date and was very satisfied both times."
"This has to be the best steakhouse in Houston, and I've eaten at many.  Great Texas museum like setting, with many interesting historic documents and artifacts.  Love the food, especially any type of steak - sure to be top quality.  Then - after dessert - you can take pictures wearing a Texas cowboy hat.  Pretty cool atmosphere with unbeatable food.  Family of four eats for $200-$250."
"nice environment, currently well decorated for holidays.great service, tasty food. you need to check out when you are in houston. P.S. even had fun at the waiting area, comfortable and good for taking pictures with friends, just for fun!"
"Awesome salad bar, good tortilla soup, mouth watering steak, and delicious snicker pie plus great service. Overall, awesome experience."
"Me gusta mucho!  And I'm not all that into steaks!But when I think I want me a chunk of beef, I head here.Service is A++, decor is relaxing and fancy/casual.  You can't tell whether you should be prim and proper or in flip flops but no matter, the service is exceptional and everyone treats you the same!Salad bar is a must - especially the bread, raspberry vinaigrette dressing, and more recently, the pineapple slices!Their garlic butter which I always ask for on the side is to die for.  I like to taste my steak without the sauce and then dip in the sauce as I go.Desserts are heart attacks on a plates but delicious nevertheless, although I suggest sharing one with the whole table to save your health.Just how good is it?I've changed my boyfriend's mind about the prime rib he swears by at Houston's to becoming a Taste of Texas fan!  He says that even though the prime rib he got at TOT did not have the bone which helps infuse the flavors into the meat, it was still more flavorful and tender than prime rib at Houston's on a good day there!  I can't believe this die-hard Houston's fan is now into Taste of Texas!  You have no idea how much I've tried to convince him there are better places than just Houston's."
"I found this restaurant through my girlfriend's iphone via the urbanspoon application. We decided to pay a visit and I must say, we left very satisfied.Want a thick slice of juicy steak? This is as good as it gets. I love the ambiance of this restaurant and the service was excellent here. The menu items are a little on the pricy side, but it is worth every single penny. 3 dollars more also gets you access to the salad bar, but I doubt you would really need it. Come here for the steak and you will leave very satisfied."
"Great place! Love the Texas history. Shrimp cocktail, quail bites, and stuffed jalapeños were amazing. String onions.... Not so much. Steaks were all amazing. Salad bar and the cheese blocks were a nice touch"
"Great service. Occasionally the waiter doesn't come by often enough, but that is unusual. Check the hours if coming for lunch. They don't offer lunch on the weekends. I have forgotten a few times.The steaks are really good, but this is also an excellent steak house for vegetarians. They have a truly fabulous salad bar. (we often just come for salads). They also have a vegetable entree.A darn good cheeseburger and the BEST key lime pie on the planet. A little-known tip- ask for a cup of their Off-the-menu cinnamon coffee with dessert. It is delish, and complimentary. :-) Other freebies: free dessert on your birthday and anniversary.My first visit was 20 years ago as a second-grader on a school field trip. We got a free lunch and a nice tour of the restaurant. I think they still host schools. What a great little contribution to the community.A good choice for out-of-towners. Also, just noisy and casual enough that we have made it through the meal with a toddler and baby. A risky venture, though."
Unbelievably loud. Seating crammed in like cattle. Steaks were equal to Outback. Paying for The Double Tree getting served The Best Western.
"having traveled for a living definitely has its advantages. They have some of the best cut meat money can buy. I have eaten at tons of steak houses and I'd have to say this place separates themselves from the rest.  Food and service was great. Came on a Friday w/o reservation and we almost walked away do to the one hour wait; however, I am glad we stayed because it was definitely worth the wait."
Great salad bar. Great steak. Great service. No complaints but be warned that the steaks are not as seasoned so that you taste the quality of the beef. Bring a fat wallet.
"I don' t know what the hype is all about... Was the steak good? Yes, very good. But everything else was just... meh.... especially considering the price point.I like that the place is casual but maybe it's just too casual to be a steakhouse. When I dine out, I'm not just going someplace for the food, I'm going for the service, the ambiance, the whole experience. You're telling me I have to make my own salad AND load up my own bread basket? (And by the way, the steak prices are comparable to Fleming's, Vic & Anthony's, Spencer's, et al.)Can't I have this same experience at home?Our server was very friendly and nice... a bit talkative but I'm fairly sociable so I dealt with it. The old fashioned (my standard measuring stick of an establishment's barkeep) was diluted with club soda - fail. The wine was good but a tad lacking on the variety available by the glass. I like the concept but it just doesn't justify the price. I'm far from cheap but when you drop this kind of coin, expectations are higher. I probably won't be back. Not because the food was horrible, because it just isn't worth it with all the other steakhouses out there.A great steak does a great steakhouse not make."
"There was so much I loved about Taste of Texas starting the the atmosphere, the service, the bread, and ending with the salad bar.  I say ending with the salad bar, because my steak was underwhelming.  Good, but not great.  The fact that I was so taken with the place up to that point that is made it even a bigger blow.  Even more annoying was the ""plate"" I was given.  It was some metal contraption surrounded by wood that moved whenever I tried to cut my steak.  It was also small and when combined with the placement of the bone it was nearly impossible to get  angle for cutting."
Best prime rib and salad bar. Stellar customer service/waitstaff. Very clean with a great atmosphere.
"I've been going here for years and had celebrated my birthday every single year. As a frequeny customer, I find the steaks and salad bar to be amazing, but in recent years, the new additions and subtle changes seem to be negative. One area is the salad bar, it has gotten smaller with a little less variety, although still plently. I guess the recession hit good old taste of texas. Regardless, this place is still amazing."
"This place is absolutely amazing! The food, atmosphere, service, EVERYTHING! You get more than you pay for in my opinion.  I love being able to go back and pick your own steak, the sides are scrumptious, and the service is so wonderful and quick.  I am not a big steak person, but my boyfriend is.  I tasted his steak and it was to die for! This place makes me want to eat steak on a regular basis!"
"Taste of Texas just keeps getting better and better.  We've been visiting for over 20 years and come away each time so happy with every aspect of the place.  It's Clean, clean, clean.  While wait staff don't stand around often, when they do, they are polishing wine glasses.  The salad bar has the freshest, best selection imaginable, with fresh baked bread in three varieties, butter, flavored or not is so good.  Pick your own cut of meat, always cooked to perfection.  Appetizers are to die for.  Beware only of the cost of alcoholic beverages, it your not careful it will double the size of your bill.  I love the Taste of Texas!  Keep up the good work and if you're visiting Houston, it's a must."
Excellent service and food. Come casually dressed as this is not a very formal place although I would like it to be. Enjoyed the fact that I was able to go to the kitchen to pick out my porterhouse steak (my first time picking a steak out from the kitchen) The jalapeno cornbread is awesome a long with the salad bar options. The best part was that we were given an option for free dessert for my birthday; we had a choice from all the dessert options. All in all great experience and great food. Our waiter was nice enough to give us some jalapeno corn bread to go too.ps- They took a picture of us and the dessert/printed it and stuck it on a card which I thought was very thoughtful. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
"Upon entering the restaurant you see all the reviews of being number one. The wait was 45 mins when we arrived on a Thursday night. I figured, wow it must be good. Anyway, when we got to the bar, I saw this piece of cow hanging off this dude's plate. What? are you serious?? He must want a heart attack. We finally get seated, our waiter was really nice. He actually prided himself on regurgitating Taste of Texas statistical information. ""we cook 3,000 steaks a day"" and ""it takes us 3,000 man hours to put up Christmas decorations"" (cough - Loser) Anyway, the group of us ordered 3 appetizers and then found out there was a salad bar. The salad bar was good, lots of variety! The bread.....well, the bread....the BREAD! Was the BOMB!!! Did I tell you the bread was the bomb. the butter was even better. Okay, off of the bread. The appetizers came we ordered, stuffed mushrooms - good! onions strings - good! spinach dip - okay. At that point we had food up to our necks, but we kept going. I ordered the Tbone and the au gratin. the Tbone seemed to be the smallest besides the prime rib or fillet. Everything else on the menu was 10lb or greater. Yeah, a vegan nightmare, you know. The Tbone was good, I had better, but again I had food up to my neck so i think i lost all sense of taste. The waiter gave a tour of the kitchen. That was pretty decent. He was really working for that tip. HMMM, he didn't tell us how much he makes in tips every day. Maybe $3,000 pennies??? When we returned back to the table, we ordered 3 desserts. What?!?!? I am about to die. Anyway, I had the creme brule. It was tasty. Needless to say, when I got home I walked my dog 2 times around the block. I just had to work off the feeling on gluttony. I also surprised him with a juicy bone!! YAY Taste of Texas"
"It's definitely not one of the top steakhouses but for newcomers and visitors to Houston, its a must!  The ambience is truly TEXAN and first time visitors always receive a red bandana to commemorate the occasion! Don't get me wrong, I love me a mouth-watering steak, but I would have to say that the complimentary salad bar is what keeps me coming back!  Last night, I decided to have the salad as my meal and it Its fresh and has such a diversity of options. Did I mention the cinnamon butter yet?!?!  Quick tip- come early or come late but not during peak dinner times because your wait will be at least 45 minutes to 1.5 hours!"
Service was great!  Beyond great.  Other than not so good. For starters I had the hand cut ribeye 20oz.  My opinion for price for the steak they should at least use dry aged steaks.  I have bought same quality of meat local grocery store for about 1/4 of the price granted I had to cook it but still.  I didn't mention noise. Loud!!!
"I've lived in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Springfield, MO...without a doubt, this place served the best steak I've ever had!  I've had the New York Strip, T-Bone, and the Center Cut Fillet (16 oz medium rare)!  Although it's pricey, the meat melts/dissolves in your mouth.  I've had some mediums and medium well...and it's nothing like the jerky feeling you get from other steak house!  Whenever my family or friends visit Houston, I proudly take them here!  The salad is amazing too!  They have all sorts of dressings (cilantro dressing is great!) and the bread and butter are awesome too!  They have free complementary drinks (Sprite, Coke, and Diet Coke) while you wait!  There is like an hour+ wait during the weekends, but it's all worth it!  Hands down, this is my favorite steak place I've ever been to!"
"The service is simply awesome. The waiter made sure my glass was always full and was very attentive. Food came quickly and the delivery timing for each coarse was perfect. Salad bar was fresh and a meal in itself. Had pecan encrusted chicken, simply delicious.  I definitely plan to return."
"I took my 2 employees here for a end of the year lunch. After getting used to the mediocre service and the Houston-based chains, I was thinking that this place wouldn't be as good as I heard. Luckily, the service was absolutely fabulous. I don't do salad so I got to watch the waiter fold their napkins everytime they got up. I loved this so I guess I should go to more places that don't have drive-thrus! The food was beyond divine. My steak was absolutely butter! We talked and talked during our lunch and ended up being there for 2-1/2 hours. At no time did I ever feel like they wanted us out of there. They continued to make sure our needs were met. I can tell you that I left the biggest tip because of the amount of time we were there and the impeccable service. I have been to other restaurants for long meals and had the staff try to push me out the door. The service I received here will definitely bring me back. Yes, it is expensive but you get what you pay for."
This is a good steak but not great. Just doesn't compare to the top prime steak houses in Houston. It is still good and I enjoy the salad bar but if you are expecting the steak to blow you away then you will be disappointed.
Does not live up to the hype. Steak was prepared correctly But did not taste aged at all. Great sides. Will not try again.
"I like this place even though i dont think the steaks are really that great... I love the salad bar, the fresh bread, and etc. The steaks nice but nothing special about them. I use to be the biggest fan of texas steak but upon moving to NYC i had Peter Luger and NY porter house and i was convinced that my memory still said texas steak was better. SO when i came back home for the first time in about 2 yrs after moving to NYC i stopped by taste of texas for some texas steak. Unfortunately texas steak didnt live up to what i remembered... it was a little bland and not special at all. I was extremely disappointed. BUT thats comparing it to Peter Luger. I still love this place and would come here again but it wasnt as good as i remembered. I like the novelty of picking your own steak but im guessing that the steak here isnt dry aged. since it all looked extremely fresh. I love the cinnamon butter here i really wish they would bring back that steak challenge!! I dont feel like going all the way to  Amarillo for the Big Texan steak challenge. THey need one in Houston!"
top notch service and tour of establishment.  they took me and i got to pick the exact cut of meat i wanted.  they cooked it medium rare just right.   the manager was very kind and helpful.  extremely professional and well run restaurant.  will come again.
"This may be one of the best places to have a really good meal.  I have been here on many occasions and never been disappointed.  The steaks are great, full of flavor.  You can even pick the exact one you want if need be.  I feel that the atmosphere is family friendly and great for groups.Service is great, all around a good place to go.  Worth the wait and price."
"I moved from Houston and I STILL miss this place and talk about it!  They had the best service of any restaurant I've ever been too!   I loved their salad bar such fresh great choices and the pinneapple tasted like sweet tarts!  I always got their pecan crusted chicken that was stuffed with spinach and brie cheese served with wild rice.  When you order a soda they bring it along with a 1/2 caraf so you don't have to waite for them to give you refills!  My friends never complained about their steaks or burgers!  Great atmosphere, awesome service!  I soo miss this place!"
"The steak itself doesn't beat mama's cooking, but the high-variety high-quality salad and bread bar more than makes up for it. The staff is very friendly and hospitable, and the clean, wood-paneled, candlelit atmosphere is homely and comforting. I see why this place is one of the most prestigious steakhouses in Houston, if not all of Texas."
"I LOVE this place! This place is always packed, day or night, weekday or weekend-- bc it is great! FAIR PRICES FOR GREAT FOOD! For around $38, I can get a small filet (absolutely delicious by the way), INCLUDING the wonderful salad bar, bread, and side dishes. I have gone to many other steak places that you pay separately for everything, and then it always adds up to at least $60-70 per person (not including drinks), and sometimes it's not even that great (Perry's, for example).  I think that this place is not only priced right, but the quality is wonderful-- they even have sodas and popcorn while you wait to be seated. I guess if I had any complaint, it would be long wait times, but I guess that is just bc it is so popular- WORTH THE WAIT!"
"Hands down my absolute favorite special-occasion family restaurant. Great for groups, but as always, when you're coming in with a group of 12, anticipate that your food will suffer. Whenever people come into town, I take them here because it embodies Texas in such a way that is lost in the myriad of chain steakhouses. There is a freakin' stuffed bear in it, for crying out loud! This place is pretty expensive for how casual it can be but the food is just quality. I think they have the best filet in town and certainly one of the best values: $38 for a 10 oz. filet, all-you-can-eat salad bar, and a side. Service is more or less good and helpful. My only gripe about this place is that it is just too damn busy. We often wait an hour and 45 minutes starting at 5:00 on a Saturday. If you get there at 6:00, forget it. You'll be circling the parking lot for the next half and hour and constantly toying with the idea of parking at Fuddruckers and risk getting your car towed. They offer complementary chips, salsa, popcorn and sodas if it is any consolation. But it never is. Also, if, by any chance, they try and sit you at the bar after your two hour wait, speak to someone and they'll fix it. The last time I went, we were sat at the bar. We didn't really care but if it was a different, important situation, it would have mattered a lot more. I strongly recommend this place, and most importantly, order the FILET ONLY. Don't order the rib-eye, t-bone, or porterhouse here. It's been done before-- they are not up to par with the filet."
"Taste of Texas is absolutely my favorite restaurant for a quiet dinner special occasions or a quiet lunch.  The salad bar is incredible - especially because of the abundance of fresh fruit, the delicious homemade bread and the many salad toppings including pecans!  Some of the steaks are expensive of course  but if you don't want to spend so much you can have a wonderful meal at a very reasonable price. My son always gets a steak, his wife usually gets the salad bar as a meal, and my husband and I get the marinated steak skewer which includes the salad bar and is delicious and very reasonably priced.  The desserts are heavenly and I love that they bring the dessert tray to the table.   The staff is well trained.  If you don't want to wait you have to plan your visit carefully  - this is a VERY busy place for good reason!  But for instance getting there for lunch at 11 is usually a safe bet.  My son always takes us to Taste of Texas for Mother's Day (a long standing tradition for us) but we now go the week before or after Mother's Day early Saturday or Sunday evening - same wonderful food, service and ambiance without the wait.  The only difference is I don't get a rose. :-) I can live without the rose! :-)  He also takes us there for my birthday which is a few days after Christmas.  Hmmmm.  Christmas is pretty much packed anytime they are open because of the wonderland they turn it in to.  So for my birthday we sometimes just go and happily wait with everyone else!  :-)   Any time we have out-of-town company, Taste of Texas is always in our plans.  I have never been disappointed with anyone's reaction - it is a great place to take family, friends,  guests or business associates.  When there is a wait,  they even make the wait comfortable by providing complimentary popcorn, chips/salsa and soft drinks!  There are great places all around the property to take pictures of your group.  All in all Taste of Texas is my favorite place to dine!"
"I had a delicious bone-in filet cooked to my delight.  High-quality meat The salad bar and rolls were superb.  Overall the food was better than I expected.  Service was good.  Very large place, so it had a different feel than your typical low-lighting steakhouse"
"I know there are many more steakhouses in Houston that are probably better than Taste of Texas - but this was the first place I had real steak and I will always love it. My parents felt embarrassed when we brought my uncle (the one with super high expectations) and I mentioned it was the first time I had eaten steak outside of home..this was during either 8th or 9th grade. I've always thought this place offered the best bang for your buck. Salad bar - fresh everything! Bread - umm can't get enough. Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon- medium rare - only way to go. I will only get the Filet here, but I've tried other steaks and just didn't like them as much. The service has always been great here and I love that it's a steakhouse that isn't super stuffy/ semi-formal attire required. However, I could easily do without the 1.5- 2 hour waits during the weekends, so I'd definitely advise going on a weekday or just getting there for an early dinner on the weekend (esp. if you have a big party). I've spent hours waiting - eating popcorn, drinking sodas, watching tv - and in the end, it is always worth it. Can't wait to go back!"
"This is our ""go to"" place for celebrations!  It is pricey, but so worth it!  The food is great, and the service is outstanding.  The salad bar is very fresh.  Don't overlook the pineapple slices, which are usually super sweet and juicy.  The breads are tasty, and the cinnamon butter is to die for!  I also love the gigantic blocks of Wisconsin cheddar at the end of the salad bar.  The steaks are very tender and cooked to order.  You can choose your own steaks if you want to.  The vegetables that come with the meals are perfectly cooked... a bit crispy almost!  The waiters are friendly and very attentive.  There is always wait staff around to straighten up your table while you're at the salad bar, bring anything you need, refill drinks, etc.  Other notable items are the pomegranate martinis, cappuccinos (even decaf ones!) and the apple dumplings, which are served with the most delectable Blue Bell cinnamon ice cream."
"I went to Taste of Texas not to long ago with my sweet love and it was absolutely perfect!!!I got the filet and my love got the bone-in filet , are streaks couldn't have been any better !!! :) cooked soo perfect!! I got a huge potato fully loaded man sooo freakn good! and green beans with almonds  I LOVED IT ALL!! the waiter was cool as shit!! He took really good care of us! Thanks Taste of Texas! Awesome!"
Grilled Salmon with asparagus.  Awesome! As was my husbands 16 oz ribeye.  Forgot how much we loved this place.  Service was outstanding.  Salad bar above average and fresh baked bread was soft hot and delicious.  Wait to be seated was 1 1/2  hours-- yes I said 1 1/2 hours was worth it!
"Taste of Texas is a great restaurant!  Wonderful steaks, great service!  The jalapeno shrimp appetizers (along with the baked brie) are just great!  There is a reason that you wait in line to eat there, wait in the bar and have a glass of wine!                                                       review by Vaughan"
"We picked this restaurant for a company dinner after a day at the office. Parking is a little challenging, but that is just because they obviously fill up (even on a Wednesday). However, the staff seated us very quickly and never missed a beat. The service is exactly what you'd expect from a 1st class steak house, and the food is excellent."
"I use to LOVE Taste of Texas... until I discovered Papa's Steakhouse, Vic and Anthony's, or the other 100000 better steakhouses in Houston. The only good thing that I enjoy about Taste of Texas is the salad bar.The past THREE times I have gone there the person I have gone with (boyfriend/friend) have had their steaks incorrectly cooked. My boyfriend ordered it medium rare-medium and it comes out completely RARE. I love eating my steaks medium rare or even a little on the rare side, but this was completely rare in the middle. This happened TWICE! They cooked it correctly the second time, but they should really take the other persons food and recook it also. I don't really enjoy eating by myself when my boyfriend doesn't have his food. They apologized and the waitress was really nice. I wrote on a comment card the second time this happened and they mailed me a 25 gift certificate which was very nice. I decided to take my friend there the next time because she is a taste of texas fan. We went and the SAME thing happened again. She wanted her steak medium well and it came out medium rare. The second time she specified she only wanted a little bit of pink inside and it came back out and was medium rare again. She just told the waitress that she would cook it herself on the hot plate, and she did what she said! haha. I'm definitely never going to come to Taste of Texas ever again. There is no reason to go there when there are steakhouses that are so much better. Try Papas or Vic's and you'll never want to go to Taste of Texas again!"
"If you are looking to spend quality time, have great Texas steak, and enjoy Christmas then this is the place to be. Do arrive early enough to wait in line. The place is very popular and people are willing to wait for hours, it's just that good. We usually reserve the place in line and go to the ""City Center"" for an hour, which is located with in the walking distance of the restaurant. This is not the place to visit on a budget, but whatever money you spend will be worth every dollar. The stake is like no other in Houston - I recommend the Cowboy Steak. This was a second year for us to visit the restaurant for Christmas and I think it will be our new tradition. One more thing - bring your camera! The restaurant is decorated with lots of Christmas decorations. You will want to take a picture by the fireplace... Regarding parking: park at ""bed bath and beyond"" it is closer then the restaurant parking lot."
"Love love love Taste of Texas. They don't take reservations, but if you have enough time, it's definitely worth the wait. I take everyone who visits to Taste of Texas. The salad bar is great as well, and well worth it. Love the huge blocks of cheese. Another great thing about Taste of Texas is you can choose your own meat. You can choose how marbled, how thick, etc you want your cut. If you order ribeye, you can order exactly how many oz you want as well and the thickness. Taste of Texas is a wonderful place and a must-have if you've never had it."
"BEST STEAK IN HOUSTON. You have to get the sizzling garlic butter, it makes the steak even better. Beautiful cuts of meat, amazing service, great salad bar, perfect bread (that you pick out on your own - regular, jalapeño corn bread or cheese rolls with butter, sweet butter and honey) I honest got too full to try my broccoli but our amazing server boxed it up for me so I'll eat it leftover for lunch tomorrow. Yes, you will have to wait - but it is more than worth it. We arrived at 6:46 on a Friday and were seated by 7:20. They have popcorn, soda and chips and salsa for free while you wait plus a huge bar and waiting area so you can start your evening with pre-dinner drinks. Our server was so great, asked if we had a special occasion, made suggestions, boxed my food, seriously superb service. I can't wait to come back here. My favorite restaurant ever hands down. Oops I ate my food too fast to take pictures"
"By far the BEST steak I've ever had. I don't think there is any restaurant out there that compares to the steak at Taste of Texas. I ordered the 10oz fillet with the garlic butter topping, medium rare. Steak is aged for 30+days making it melt in your mouth tender. I've never had such tender steak. My brother order the filet mignon topped with crab cake which was also fantastic. Although the salad bar is extensive so there is no need to order an appetizer, we still went ahead and got the jalapeño stuffed shrimp which I highly recommend! The cheese rolls with the cinnamon butter are also amazing -I must have eaten 4 rolls! For dessert we ordered the pecan crust pumpkin cheese cake and which paired with a coffee is a great way to finish a meal. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. The wait can be 2+ hours on the weekends but extremely worth it. People come from all over the state and across the country to try the steak here! Tip: if you come in around 4 for an early dinner the wait is more like a half hour."
"It always works out that Trevor B. hates a place for no good reason, and then I goad him into going there and it turns out he's right. I hate it when that happens. It was so hard for Taste of Texas to live up to the hype though that I almost can't blame the restaurant. So, for the good: The service is impeccable at ToT. I think their wait staff should train all the other wait staff in Houston and then maybe I could have a decent dining experience everywhere I go. Drinks were refreshed continuously, and our waiter, Justin, was attentive and helpful. The ambiance is nice - mood lighting and a fire cast a warm glow about the place. I almost forgot it was the middle of the afternoon.In terms of taste, the salad bar was really good. Unfortunately, from all the raves I had heard about it, I pictured it to be a vast expanse stretching from one end of the restaurant to another. in reality, it's quite small as far as size, but the pre-made salads were delicious overall and it had fresh yummy bacon. I was not a big fan of the oversized cheese blocks ... something about my cheese being vulnerable and sitting out in the open like that. I did not partake.I could have eaten 10 of the dinner rolls and 10 more pieces of cornbread and rolled away quite happy.The bad: Overall, the food was average. I ordered my cowboy steak medium rare, but by the time I had taken a few bites of it, it had come up to temperature at a solid medium. Normally, I would have sent it back, but I was distracted by a cranky infant and I had already eaten enough of it to be underwhelmed anyway. The meat tasted okay, but it was a bit of ribeye gone wrong, much more fatty than I would expect for the price. (For the record, I know that the attraction of a ribeye is the marbling, but in a well-cooked ribeye, the fat melts into the meat to provide all the flavor so you don't have to contend with ribbons of it in each bite.) The au gratin potatoes that I ordered on the side generally tasted like cream and potatoes. I should've sliced a sliver of cheese from the salad bar to mix in.The ugly: My steak came to me on a ridiculous cow-shaped plate that was exactly the same size as my steak. No room to cut. No room to move the surgically removed fat tendrils to one side. It also wasn't level on the bottom so it rocked and clicked with each knife swipe. I almost slapped my steak onto the table in frustration. Let's not be cute, I just want to eat.Overall, I was really disappointed with the whole experience. Maybe it's because I had such an amazing experience at Fleming's recently. Maybe it's because Trevor B's shrimp so offended him that he ruined my experience overall. Maybe, baby.But there's no maybe about it; I don't think I'll be going back."
Best salad bar in Houston! Delicious jalapeño corn bread.  The service is great and gratuity is never included which means the servers strive to earn it.  Big fan of the chocolate cake; it's gigantic!  Center-cut filet is always my choice but I recommend having them butterfly it so they know it's perfect before you cut into it.  Also love the Christian music in the restrooms.
"I think this place represents Texas so well.  It's homey but a just a tad classier than you'd expect.  Large families and groups of friends are accommodated well and that's also pretty Texas.The best appetizer are the crabcakes.  They are to die for.  Large chunks of crab meat with minimal breading.  I would have never known to order these but the people we were with knew about their greatness.The steaks are good, not the best, but good.  They could use a bit more seasoning.  The salad buffet line is overkill.  The bread is so good with all the different butter and spreads you can put on them.  Try to limit yourself at the bar so that you can save room for dessert!The make your own sundae ice cream is fantastic.  Cinnamon ice cream is a lovely treat. You'll leave this place stuffed and it is a bit on the pricey side, but it's so worth it."
"We recently went to Taste of Texas to celebrate one of my friend's birthdays for lunch. The birthday girl had the salad bar and a baked potato, while the rest of us had the Grilled Tenderloin Salad. Just thinking of this salad makes my mouth water. The pieces of tenderloin, which is marinated to give it a perfect balance of sweet and salty, sit atop a bed of mixed greens with pieces of grapefruit, avocado, grilled red onions and candied almonds. There is also a fried blue cheese croquette that sits on the top of the salad. All of this is topped with a cilantro vinaigrette that marries everything together.  I usually don't eat the whole piece of fried blue cheese because it is a little pungent for my taste. Our server's name was Steven, who was awesome. He and I engaged in a delightful chat about our favorite wines. Unfortunately, my pregnant state allows me to do more talking about wine, rather than drinking it. He mentioned a Silver Oak vintner's dinner next month, which I wish I could attend. He also suggested that the next time I drink, I should try a pinot noir with a nice filet. One thing that I probably would have never thought of doing.Steven educated us on a few other things that day - apparently they make all of their bread and accompaniments on the premises. Even the delightful little slices of candied almonds that my friends loved are made in house.  Pros: Good salad bar; fresh hot bread; Good place for lunch; Good service; Excellent place to take visiting relativesCons: Somewhat on the pricey side when everyone orders steaks; No reservations so your wait (especially weekend nights) can be long"
"We waited for about 50 minutes but it was worth the wait.  I came here and the steak was really good.  I had the prime rib and it was very tasty. THe salad was great.  THey have the cuts of meat to choose from in the back of the restaurant on display, like in a butcher shop, which was the first time I had seen in a restaurant...."
"Taste of Texas may be the premiere dining experience available in the Houston area. Food is of excellent quality, and the service is second to none. Prepare to feast!"
"I was so excited to come and get a big texas steak from a steak house which was highly recommended to us.  Sadly I was not nearly impressed as I had hoped to be.We came in on Tuesday at about 5pm, thankfully at a time where there is no wait.  Looks like the wait can be super long sometimes though, yikes!We were sat and were introduced to our waiter.  He answered a few questions and seemed really nice, then he was gone and another guy was there to serve us... then another guy trying to swoop on our table.  It became a little confusing.Finally after all the waiter confusion, we ordered.  My mom and I picked the new york steak to share since it was at least twice the size of what I could consume and a glass of wine.Wine was good.  The waiter brought me a taste of two of them which I always find a very nice gesture.  The pour on the wine was also a nice size.We went to the salad bar.  I will give this place props on their salad bar it was pretty awesome.  The downfall of it though is our table felt so far from it, if you wanted something again, it felt like such a journey to go back.The steak and sides came and were nothing spectacular.  The steak seemed a little odd in texture and the mushrooms were terrible.  The veggie was so unmemorable I order, I don't even know what it was now...Especially for the price of this place, I won't go out of my way to go back!"
baked brie = goodfilet migon = juicy & tender! salad bar & bread = yummmy!snickers cheesecake = heaven :)
"The true Taste of Texas is meatAnd beef lovers crave some to eat.   So, serve a filet   With which she can playThen smile as she downs that thick treat. Playing with your food might best be done in a private setting, but Taste of Texas certainly isn't lacking in thick slabs of beef that can whet any appetite for meat. In the December 2007 Texas Monthly Magazine, ToT was designated as one of the eight best steakhouses in Houston. It undoubtedly deserves this recognition. ToT has always delivered for me whether I was in a small party or a large group. I don't believe its quality ranks up there with Pappas Bros. but it will consistently provide you with a top quartile dining experience. This place is great for large parties whether they be corporate or friends from out of town. Be prepared to wait at least 1/2 hour when your group is large (they don't take reservations). On their website, they simply state, ""Guests are seated in order of arrival."" ToT does accommodate you with a waiting area that features TV screens, free popcorn and drinks.Before you dive into your main entree, you can sample their decent salad bar (note: it doesn't compare with Fogo de Chao's), bread and self-cut slices from massive hunks of cheese.The wait staff are friendly and very entertaining when you're with a large party.Their steaks are very good, but not great. The price for most of the steak entrees is around $35 which raises one's expectations. ToT is a major league steakhouse, but like that minor league pretender, Outback, they have a tendency to over-season the beef. I really like their prime rib (served voluptuously rare). Their 18 oz cut is a carnal delight. I'll also admit to having finished off their gargantuan 32 oz Porterhouse on a few occasions and then hibernated for the rest of the week."
"Great place for lunch.  The salad bar was awesome!!!! The Waite staff was very attentive to your needs, made suggestions, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  I will definitely return for additional meals."
"Whenever people ask me for my favorite Houston restaurant, I say Taste of Texas.  Why?  Because it's a steakhouse where you can go in jeans, slice yourself a chunk of cheese and enjoy really good food.  It's not exactly a place for a cheap date, but hey - you're getting REALLY good steak and you definitely get what you pay for.  They start you off with really good butter/jam and toasted morsels (I can't help but ask for more) and the waitstaff has always been friendly and helpful.  The salad bar is wonderful - you get fresh veggies, dressings, and you can end your trip to the salad bar with a basket of bread.Be sure not to stuff yourself with too much at first - I've made that mistake before.The filets are tender, but I prefer the soft and moist prime rib above the other slabs of meat I have had there.  At Christmas time, they deck out the place with garland, nutcrackers, and lights - and it's nice to chill out by the waiting area or massive fireplace.I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a relaxed way to spoil a significant other - or a trip with some friends and family for some good food and conversation.I want to go back right now...."
"One of the best places to eat in Houston Texas. I have been here many time for special occasions as well as for the better-than-usual steak. Dress up a little to eat here or you will feel out of place. The restaurant has a great salad bar featuring some really good cheeses, everything is extremely fresh, hot bread and a variety of butters, and a great produce selection. You have the option of choosing your piece of steak, and they will cook your meat exactly the way you ask for it  delicious. A very nice treat if you're in town!"
Best Steaks EVER! the wait is worth it... love it! try it! We go when ever we can
Save your money. If you want a great steak - try Ruth's Chris. Ruth's serves aged beef and it's unbelievable! Once you try their steaks you'll be dissapointed with pretty much any other beef place.
"This restaurant was a blast to eat in. As we were leaving new orleans it was an estimated six hours to get here. We left at 4 pm which may have meant we got there right before or right after they close. Even if we got there just befire they closed the kitchen might have shutdown for the night. We call the place and they said just get here before 10 and ur good. Long story short we made it there at 945. We got immediate seating and looked at their menu. Its VERY pricey but its worth it. I got the center cut filet which was the most expensive cut they had. It was tender,juicy and moist. The steak was done a brilliant medium rare. The others had prime rib or ribeye steak. Each were fantastic. With sides and trip to salad bar it was about 200 for the 4 of us. Lemme say each of us agree it was a great way to end this icon trip. Service was top notch always attentive, but maybe it was because we were like one of two or three parties there. I may check this place out again when I'm in Houston in the future. Ambience was classy but casual wear was accepted."
"ADIDOS TASTE OF TEXASI will not return to this restaurant. I took my son Saturday evening, celebrating his 15th birthday. We are used to waiting 1 1/2- 2 hrs. for a table as we did Saturday evening. Once we were seated we placed our orders. I ordered my steak and told the waiter- please extra well and went on to tell him- we have been here before and most times I have to return my steak because there is red when I cut into it, so please ask them to grill it extra well. Of course was his response. Our meal arrives, my son's steak was fine, I cut into my steak and red blood spills out. Really? I asked the waiter to please throw it back on the grill. As I wait..........and wait.......25 minutes later, my son is completely finished eating his meal, here comes my steak. So....we wait almost 2 hours to be seated, so my son can eat his meal ALONE, and then I can eat my steak a half hour later. I asked the waiter to take it away, I have lost my appetite. A manager comes over and offers me his card, so I can look for him next time we come so we don't have this problem again- are you kidding me? I should come here again...place my order...then try to find this idiot and tell him to see to it they cook my steak the way I ordered it. I don't want this jerk's card. And I agree with another review about the guy at the front- dark hair, thinks he is Mr. Buff in his suit- he was as rude as heck to me when I asked what number they were up to. What a POS to have at the front door greeting patrons. Adidos Taste of Texas- you have left a bad taste in my mouth."
"went there on a field trip in 4th grade, from what i remember it was a nice place. It was cute since they showed us kids the freezer and then closed us in there for like 3 seconds. We got so scared! My 4th grader mind recalls that the chicken nuggets were good."
"OMG Becky, this steak is so good!  I am a steak fanatic and this is THE BEST STEAK I have ever had.  The filet is so juicy and melts in your mouth.  It was well worth the 90 minute wait.  If you get a chance, go during Christmas time to get in the spirit with all of the Christmas decor.  The salad bar is yummy too, but don't get full before your steak comes.  Heaven in your mouth!"
"Outstanding atmosphere, food, and service. Salad bar is the best in Houston. Steaks are fantastic, not the very best I've ever had, but very close. Definitely in my top two or three steakhouses."
Great steakhouse. I love being able to choose my own cut of beef. The salad bar is amazing and the wine selection is pretty diverse as well. Be warned the wine per glass price is a little ridiculous. The best time to go is at Christmas when it's all done up. They also have a great waiting area with free sodas and popcorn for the kids. Try it out!!
"Welcome to Texas, where the appetites are big and the helpin's even bigger.  If you're ever in (arguably) the ""other"" armpit of America and you're not borderline atherosclerotic, make it a point to stop here for certified angus beef (aged 30-35 days). This restaurant is always bustling; you'd think it was a tourist attraction. That being said, take a number and be prepared to wait.  Well-equipped for the crowds, they have an entire section with tables, chairs, tvs, free popcorn, chips & salsa and soda dedicated to those patiently, eagerly waiting to get their grub on.  Oh, and did I mention the towering, stuffed grizzly bear in the lobby?  At any moment, you'll witness kids, bachelor and bachelorette groups hanging on the poor fella for photo ops. All steak, prime rib, and lobster dinners are served as a complete meal (NOT a la carte!  Bravo!) with your choice of all-you-can-eat salad from the bar, freshly baked (and I mean right out of the oven), warm varietal breads and a side order. I have to consciously cut myself off the salad/bread bar as I suffer from the tendency to get full prematurely.  My strong (*emphasis*) recommendation is the center cut filet mignon (request that it be bacon-wrapped) flavored with the house-speciality lemon pepper seasoning and garlic butter. It comes out on a sizzling cast iron skillet, and it's just SO so juicy. My friend's husband and his buddies always jest about breaking the published Taste of Texas records. Allegedly, the restaurant's best is 120-some oz in one sitting. Siiiick."
Food was Ok but service by our waiter Bobby was excellent. This guy is top of the line... First class all the way. Rarely have I had such incredible service. Shouts out to Bobby!
"Don't get me wrong, when I have out-of-Texas guests come to visit, and they want an ""authentic"" Texas experience, this is one of the first places I go, but it isn't the first place I go with friends who live here.The service is excellent, the salad bar fresh, and the steaks are good, but for me they aren't always worth the high price tag.  There are other steak houses in Houston that serve as good a steak at a better, more reasonable price tag.It is a great experience, worth an every once and a while go, but not someplace I would go to every week."
Excellent steak with a few Texas signatures. Service is top notch; you even get to pick your own steak!
"Let me start by saying that I don't really like steak all that much.  I do, however, love prime rib!  And Taste of Texas has THE BEST prime rib I have ever had.  Not only is the meat tender and cooked to your liking, but all the sides and the salad bar round out your meal perfectly.  I wish I had a ""last supper"" here before I moved out of Houston!"
"My family and I came here to have dinner for my birthday. Since they don't take reservations (only parties of 10 or more), I told my bf, who got there first to get a table because I know we would be waiting. There were four adults and one child. The wait was about 25 minutes. Before getting our table, we enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa, popcorn for the little one and drinks. I tried not eating so much chips and salsa so I wouldn't get full, but the salsa is darn good! Our table was finally ready...seemed like forever because I was hungry. Our waiter was friendly and very accommodating. We wanted to get a bottle of wine but wasn't sure what kind.  The waiter brought over two samples of red wine that everyone might like. It was a good choice because we decided to go with that type. We picked out a bottle of red wine that was highly rated on the wine menu. The waiter brought out the wine and let us try a little before he started serving everyone. We liked it very much....it was very smooth and not too strong and not too dry. It was now time for the salad bar...one of my favorite things about this restaurant. I got some romaine lettuce with caesar dressing topped with cheese, crumbled egg and bacon. I also scraped me up a few slices of cheese from the big blocks they have. The salad was great, as expected. The cornbread is also really good. We got the jalapeno stuffed shrimp for the appetizer...it was okay.  A little too cheesy for me.  I plan on trying the skewers of quail next time.  All four of us got the new york strip sirloin, cooked differently. It's a huge 16 oz. of meat to finish! My steak was cooked just right. It was tasty, juicy and scrumptious!  I probably ate only half of it.  It was just too much for me to finish with all the extra things I ate before the steak.  For my side, I got the gratin potatoes.  I was not disappointed.  They give you a choice to pick out your steak...kind of cool!  My daughter got the junior burger.  It came with a huge cheeseburger, steak fries and a huge pickle.  She could barely finish it...I would be stuffed finishing that meal.  The kids entrees are enormous. Since it was my birthday, the restaurant gave me a dessert of my choice which was on the house. They brought a creme brulee (my favorite!) with a sparkling candle out.  The waiter also had a camera to take a picture.  Moments later, he brought out a printed photo inside a little card for us to take with us.  That was real cute.  I don't know any other restaurants that do that.  Overall, I had a really great time with my loved ones.  The waiter was friendly and even gave me some oxi clean spray after splatting some steak juice on my white shirt.  The restaurant feels so welcoming, this place is always great to go with family or friends."
Best salad bar ever!  Great steaks and service.
"I went to Taste of Texas one evening around 8pm (full disclosure -- I think it was New Year's Eve), went to put a name on the wait list (note, this was for two, not ten) and was told with a straight face ""The wait is over three hours.  Here's the movie listing for the theater over there.  If you want to go see a movie, let  us know and we'll hold your table.""True story.  We didn't wait.  Or see a movie.  But that experience sort of sums up Taste of Texas:  There IS going to be a wait (unless you show up at like 4pm...or maybe on a weeknight) BUT they will try to make you as comfortable as possible during that wait.  They have a very large waiting room with tables that still over flow on a busy night -- a two hour plus wait is not untypical on a weekend.  And while you are waiting there are at least two bars where you can order a drink.  You are also welcome to help yourself to sodas, tea, popcorn and chips and salsa.  If it's a nice night, there is also seating outside. Is the wait worth it?  Eh.  Depends on your tolerance for waiting.  I am MUCH happier when I have a diet coke and some popcorn to munch on.The food is good -- they make a really big deal about their steaks and you can even go pick out your own.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but certainly very good.  And seems to be good for the price which also includes salad bar, my favorite -- the cheese blocks (really), bread (their breads are very very tasty), and a veggie side.  While I've never been there with a large group, they seem to be able to handle them quite well.  Taste of Texas is a fun place to go -- I enjoy it.  Just go early or expect to wait.  But they'll take good care of you.Oh, and their desserts are fabulous!  Save room!"
"This place is amazing.  A must go to during Christmas time.  They really spend a lot of time getting that place to feel like a country home Christmas.  The food is amazing along with the service.  Just the salad bar is worth a trip.  Go when you are hungry, because portion size is big along with the price.  The meat selection is big and all the cuts are the best and aged to perfection.  The only downside is the price.  But if you are looking for a nice fancy meal that taste great... Here is your place"
"Ok, the food is outstanding.  The salad bar is an experience in and of itself.  Don't pass on the salad bar.  The steak selection is second to none as well.  So, why three stars?  The arrogance of the waiter and his lack of attention to our group was indefensible.  He was bragging about how there is no finer steak prepared in all of Houston--that's debatable, but perhaps he should focus a little more on being at least an average waiter by Houston standards.  In my book this dude has a ways to go to make it to ""average""."
"i have always loved the taste of texas.  i went to this restaurant all the time growing up.  it was one of my dad's favorite steakhouses, if not his favorite.  so whenever we had a special occasion, we came here.  their salad bar has always been really one of my favorites. from the various but typical toppings to put on your leaves of choice to the fresh bread over with their selections of butters and not to mention their huge cheese blocks.  their bread and butter definitely melt in your mouth.  it's a great appetizer.  i've always had the 20 oz. t-bone steak when i've gone and it's always been more than i could ever handle.  the flavor is great and i like my steak medium and i like the right amount of red that they've brought everytime i've gotten my steak.  if they aren't running too busy, they sometimes even give you a tour of the kitchen and let you pick out your steak so you know what you're getting.  it's usually done mainly for first timers.their sides definitely support the dish.  i usually go for the baked potato but the wild mushrooms are great as well.  i'm a meat and tators kinda guy so you gotta fill that craving when you can.  did i also mention that IF there is a wait, that they have sort of a complimentary concession stand with free soft drinks, popcorn, and chips and salsa to curb the hunger pains if you have any while you wait.  i like it because it's a steakhouse that isn't stuffy so you can get the high quality without feeling like you should be wearing a suit and tie but you definitely can do so if you'd like.  definitely a houston staple for good steak."
"I am a long time customer, but will never go back after the way I was insulted by the manager for taking popcorn to eat at my table. I was told the popcorn was only for people waiting for a table. I said the popcorn is free and why do you feel the need to have ""popcorn police"" for what amounts to about 10 cents worth of food? On top of this he was so loud, everyone around us heard him scold us for eating the popcorn. I said that if the popcorn isn't for people to eat, then lock it up. We pay around $200 per meal and are outraged to be treated this way. I said you are willing to loose a long time customer over this and he walked away. Will they now ask for ID for people who claim to have birthday celebrations and get a free dessert? There are so many fine steak restaurants in Houston, I will never ever go back to Taste of Texas."
"Rumored to have been visited by foreign envoys at some point in time, Taste of Texas serves up memory-searing, sweet, juicy steaks that meat-eaters will always love. Go for dinner. Eat up. Enjoy!"
Not worth the time and money. Extremely long wait! Food had no (0) flavor. Please save you time and taste buds and go somewhere else!
"The best steaks & salad bar in Houston without a doubt. The wait is 2 hours for a reason, but they do have free snacks & drinks while you wait."
Went here bc the husband is always raving about it. It's good fresh steaks and their sides and salad bar are really good too. Everyone raves about the bread but I didn't think there was anything special about it. I was really impressed they bake it in house though. I don't like waiting more than an hour to eat though.
"Go to Texas roadhouse, pay 1/3 the price and get same quality"
"Went here for a banquet around lunch. Service was great but a little laid back for a restaurant like this. Food was excellent. I had steak medallions with onion strings, brown gravy on the side, aspargus spears,  and a bleu cheese stuffed tomato. The steak was ordered medium rare and came out perfectly. It was juicy with perfect grill marks on the tops. Flavorful enough on it's own to not need the gravy on the side which only added to the flavor rather than cover it. The tomato was not too great, but I don't care much for tomatos anyway. The salad bar was what I would say is only slightly better than average but fresh with a few interesting choices like sundried tomatos and shelled walnuts thrown in there. Desert was rich. I had the tower of a piece of chocolate cake which was so tall they had to prop it up with chocolate straws! It was very moist and satisfying. Overall the restaurant tries hard to be in the five star category but doesn't quite take itself seriously enough to get the extra star."
You know the place is good when you forget that you waited an hr + to get a table and all you remember was the food!!!!!!!  EVERYTHING is good! SERIOUSLY!
The best salad bar!  I get Prime Rib and my wife gets the Filet and have always been very satisfied.  Deserts are superb too.
"Disappointing. If you want a good steak, go to Del Frisco Double Eagle, Pappas Brothers or Nick and Sam's. If you want a good salad bar, head over to Fogo de Chao. If you want mediocrity, run to Taste of Texas."
I would really give them ten stars but they only have five. This is the best steakhouse ever no complaints. Service is great and steak is even better. Love the salad bar even though i hate salad.
"The BEST salad bar.  The cilantro dressing leaves you craving for more!  But... I don't come for the sald.  I come for the steak.  The first time I dined here was a good dining experience- despite the long wait.  However, my most recent visit was last February for Valentine's.  We had reservations for 6- my recommendation.  We all ordered the prime rib, and it was bleh.  I returned mine for a filet mignon, which was very good.  I was so dissapointed bc the other two couples were hoping for good food..."
"This place wasn't all it was cracked up to be by other reviews.  I think people in Texas need to get out more to see what a GOOD steakhouse is.  The food wasn't bad, but a 2 hour wait?  Really?  It's certainly not worth that!  The salad bar was alright.  The fresh baked bread was awesome.  Service was mediocre.  Definitely not all it's cracked up to be though!"
"Best steak restaurant in my life. Of course, there are more expensive but higher quality steak house in US, but Taste of Texas represents the heart of Texas food which I love so much. The #1 restaurant I recommend when I need to accommodate a visitor from Japan."
"I have been there a total of 4 times in the past 8 months. It is GREAT. I love it! Every time I go there to eat, the staff is great. I mean they are awesome. Best waiters and waitresses in town. They are friendly and informative, and they also with make sure you have a great dining experience. All four times I have gone to eat there, I always get the slow roasted prime rib. It is superb. Best prime rib I have eaten. I'll just leave it at that. They're salad bar is great. A nice large choice of different things to choose from, but what stood out to me the most was the cilantro vinaigrette. If I knew the recipe for that, I'd eat salad everyday and would never get tired of it. I could eat here every week, but I'd go broke. Great place to eat at for special occasions. There might be a long wait though, but don't worry. They offer free sodas, nachos, and other goods as you wait. Don't fill up though; the main course is the best part!"
"We arrived about 7:00 on a Thursday. The wait was estimated at about 15 to 30 minutes - we waited a little over 20 minutes. They have free self-serve soft drinks, tea, popcorn & chips while you wait. Would have preferred  a bar with waitress. We were seated and our drink order taken immediately. However it took almost 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive and our order to be taken. To munch on, they brought croutons with cream cheese and sweet salsa. It was outstanding, however they only brought 4 tiny croutons - not much bigger than a silver dollar. More of a tease than anything else.After our order was taken, we went to the salad bar. Other reviews have mentioned a dirty salad bar but this was not the case. It was very clean and all the items were very fresh and appealing. I got a cilantro vinaigrette dressing - it was fantastic. The fresh bread was hot but not anything to write home about.We both ordered prime rib medium rare. Our side was asparagus w/ hollandaise sauce. There meat was cooked properly and very delicious. It came with horseradish sauce and au jus as well as a small cup of miniature fries onions. The horseradish sauce was good but could have used a little punch. The au jus tasted like it came from a packet. It was very salty and institutional tasting. The fried onions were a waste of time. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed the beef so much, the minor imperfections in the other items were tolerable.As for the asparagus, it was too al dente for me but my sister liked it cooked that way. The Hollandaise was fair. Could have been tangier.Overall, I would recommend this place to you."
"The Taste of Texas is a good place.  If you live in the Memorial area, you need to try it.  There are better steak places in Houston, but if you want a good steak in a relaxed environment Taste of Texas is worth trying."
in fact.the service is better than the food.the steak is so so.not so special.but the dessert is really good~especially the lime cheesecake~better than in chicago~
"Great salad bar (lots of hot, fresh bread)Quite pricey though...I recommend ordering a larger cut of steak and splitting it with your dining companion, rather than ordering a steak each.I ordered a steak medium well, and it came out medium rare... I hope this isn't typicalService was attentive and courteousThey play Christian music throughout the restaurant (which I like)"
"I went there on a Thursday night and found the wait to be pretty reasonable. They have a separate bar area with drinks and snacks which is a nice touch. Be sure and get the salad bar with your meal, it's awesome. I had the 10 oz filet which was good but not great. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back."
"It all starts with the salad bar...that comes with every meal.  That alone could feed me for days.  But I made room for the grilled tenderloin medallions...pure goodness!  And THE best stuffed tomato I've ever had.  This place is just great...great service, food, and ambience!"
"One of my favorite steak restaurants EVARRR!Why do I love this place so much??  Read below:1) You can wear your nikes and baseball cap and still be able to sit down and enjoy a great piece of steak without anyone giving you the evil eye.2) The salad bar is AWESOME BLOSSOM!  Also includes different types of bread, cheese, and fruit.3) The employees are all so polite... always greeting you when you walk in and when you leave.4) A very extensive wine list at reasonable prices.5) Free popcorn while you wait for your table.6) One of THE BEST prime rib I've ever had.  So juicy, so tender, so perfect!7) Free dessert and picture for your birthday.8) You can pick your own piece of steak if you want.  I've always had them pick my meat for me and have never been disappointed.9) The servers are outstanding!  Always cleaning the table and folding your napkins for you when while you're at the salad bar.10) They give you a caraffe of whatever you're drinking (water, iced tea, coke, etc) so you can fill your own cup when you want.  Of course they'll still come by and refill for you if they notice your cup is emptly.This place is just about perfect.  The only complaint I have is that they do not take reservations, so expect over an hour wait during the weekends because this place gets PACKED!"
"Always celebrate my birthday here every year, but this year and last have left us with a bad taste in our mouths.  This year, our waitress Melissa, was really lacking in being personable, my daughter and I both felt like she was doing us a service by serving us.  Steaks were good, asparagus tough, much smaller portions of the potatoes au gratin and I've never had creme brulee that didn't have a burnt sugar top on it.   Will definitely think twice about going again back...so sad it use to be the best."
"For me, this is a great spot for special occasions. The steaks are always perfect, the salads are amazing and the staff are so friendly. If you can afford it, once a week, if not whenever you can!"
"I have always had a negative opinion of ToT despite never having eaten there.  Why?  I have no clue, honestly.  I do this quite often.  So I went.  Why?  Well, I have a wife who likes steak and has been really wanting to eat here (and basically every other steak place in the city) for some time.  I kind of like her so I agreed to go along (and by agreed I mean I understood that I had no choice).The ambiance is giant Texas hunting lodge or something.  The service is mucho friendly and attentive.  We both ordered tea and not only did a carafe arrive with our two full glasses, but the waiter would come by and pour me more tea from said carafe before I even realized I might want some.  The clientele was a little scary in just how country so many of them seemed.  Oh yeah, we went at 4:30 and the place wasn't packed but it was busy.Now to food.  I, of course, don't eat steak.  So many of you can now feel free to check out of this review.  All of my life I have disliked steak and especially now that I don't eat any red meat I...uh...don't eat steak.  Usually we are fine because most decent steak restaurants will have a sizable salad or fish (salmon or tuna being most common) offering.  Connie and I have a running joke about this because anytime we go to a restaurant and she orders a big medium rare steak and I get something light or fish-like the waiter or other helper will often bring out our entrees and put hers in front of me and mine in front of her.  Connie loves this because I am like a little girl.  Oh yeah, ToT - they have no fish selection as I prefer but instead have lobster, shrimp, and a veggie plate.  Lobster - no thanks, overpriced and I don't trust strange new restaurants with a difficult protein as most places make it bland and almost tasteless.  Veggie plate - described as consisting of portobello  mushrooms and bell peppers?  Uh, that is not a vegetable plate.  More like unwanted scraps.  No thanks.  Shrimp - I am very picky about these guys because I am sensitive to that ""shrimpy"" taste of either the not fresh or low quality selection.  They offer grilled and stuffed.  I went for the stuffed because it had jalapenos and was described as lightly fried.  I love jalapenos and thought that could work.  For me that was the first mistake.  The second was that the waiter said it only came with six and I could round it out to ten if I added a shrimp side.  I hadn't eaten all day so I asked how big they are and he made a finger gesture that suggested they were fairly small.  So, sure, supersize me.  HUGE mistake.  Maybe the actual shrimp was a small as he showed but the ""pieces of shrimp"" were giant because they were colossally breaded to be six inch diameter behemoths.  Of the four I ate (yes, I ordered ten) two were decent but had no real taste other than breading and some mild jalapeno, one was a bit ""shrimpy"", and one was badly ""shrimpy"".  I was sad.  I went back to the salad bar rather than eat any more of that garbage.Speaking of the salad bar, I expected a grand spectacle of vegetation and a cold cut colosseum after hearing so much about it.  Eh, it was fine.  DIY lettuces with a smallish selection of add-ons and a big selection of dressings.  The black and black-eyed bean salads were great a were most of the other pre-made mini-salads.  I didn't feel like bothering with the giant cheese blocks because they were nothing special and felt so exposed with everybody touching them to slice some pieces off.  Two of the three breads were great - cornbread and the round one - and the cinnamon butter sent me to happy land.I am sure Connie will weigh in eventually but her steak was not good and it was on a stupid, tiny cow plate that made eating difficult.I will not go back but they don't need me to with the traffic they get."
"I was disappointed when we went for our 1 year anniversary. We were seated by a table where 2 different families with screaming kids were seated. It was the least romantic dinner (but one of the most expensive) I've ever had. The server was good, but he wasn't very hospitable. He seemed a little distant. The food was excellent; some of the best steak I've ever had. Make sure you ask for a quiet section. And if you bring kids with you, please be sure you're considerate of other diners."
"HOLY COW, no pun intended! I was in Houston for a work conference on a quick trip and was recommended this restaurant by the rent-a-car place near Houston Hobby airport. I had my speculation that this restaurant was not going to be good, maybe another chain restaurant in the city. Boy was I wrong. The restaurant was near the highway which made it pretty simple to find. Once I found the place I was thrown back to a different era. The place is like a cabin up in the mountains with plenty of ceiling space so you don't feel claustrophobic. On a Wednesday the wait was 45 minutes to sit down. I opted instead for the bar with a full menu. The guy at the rental car place told me to try the quail bits. At 17 dollars for an appetizer I thought it was kinda steep but thought I might as well try it. It was deep fried quail wrapped with bacon. It was good. I could of done with out the glorified jalapeno poppers on the same plate though, but that is what cuts the price. I then had the prime-rib for dinner. A 16 ounce cut of beef that was awesome. This ribeye was one of the best tasting that I have had in a long time. Great deep beef flavor and my side dish was Texas scallop potatoes. Everything was great here. If I am ever in the city and want some steak I will head to this place. Awesome place. Steep on price, but well worth it."
"Excellent steaks, salad bar, and warm roll selection.  One of our favorites in Houston."
"The BF and I came here for his birthday since he is a big beef lover. I wouldn't call this a romantic restaurant, it felt more of a family friendly restaurant. So parents feel free to bring your kids! My BF LOVED our waiter. He was really nice, and friendly, and took us on a tour of the kitchen which was pretty cool. I let the BF order for us since it was his birthday. We started out with the stuffed mushrooms since the BF loves mushrooms. The mushrooms were okay. I don't think I would order them again since there were more yummy looking appetizers on the menu. The BF ordered a 16 oz steak for us to share. The steak came with either a salad or a trip to the salad bar. Since the BF does not like salad, he got a plain Cesar salad. I was a bit disappointed he didn't want a trip to the salad bar since I love salad bars due to the plethora of delicious choices. When the Cesar salad come out, it come in a cool cheese bowl that was delicious. I got a Baked Potato Soup while the BF ate his salad. The soup was okay; I wouldn't order it again. We shared a 16 oz steak. It was too bad that I was not too hungry because the steak here was delicious. For dessert, they let the BF order anything off of the dessert menu except for the chocolate cake, which was the one thing that he really wanted. Apparently, they don't make the cake at the restaurant and order it from another place. When the dessert come out with sparklers, the waiter took our picture with a Polaroid camera, put it in a paper Taste of Texas frame, and gave it to us. I thought that the picture was a really nice touch and a great marketing strategy. Unfortunately due to the price, the BF and I will be coming back here on special occasions...like our upcoming 1 year and 6 month anniversary!"
"I took 4 co-workers from out of town here last week, and couldn't have had a better experience.  From the first person who greeted us at the door to the server and salad bar guy, everyone was very gracious, efficient and obviously very well trained. The food was excellent. Too bad they don't take reservations."
"Cool presentation and unique set up (at least it used to be). The steak is good but not great, plus they have a lot of competition in the area now days. So they need to step it up. The staff is always nice."
"The high priced steaks are totally worth it due to the amazing salad bar. Fresh hot bread... sliced cheeses.  and fresh veggies galore. Honestly one of my favorites in Houston. I also like how they ask you how you want your steak flavored, and the casual atmosphere is great. Sucks they don't take reservations."
I love this place...Why???Great wait staff to begin with ... they know their menus and can explain anything you ask..Great Wine List...was even lsited in Wine Spectator this year as having a terrific wine list...And ... of course ... mmmmmm great steaks cut to your personal thickness..OOO did I mention dessert????LOL
"Sometimes I wake up singing... ""I wanna be a billionaire and eat at Taste of Texas... SO FREAKIN BAD!!""  lol! No but really.. this place is exceptionally good. Their salad bar is amazing: they have a plethora of salad options as well as two huge blocks of cheese (white and yellow)!! I love cheese and you have no idea how great this is.. you can put it on your salad, in your soup, eat it by itself. Anything your heart desires. They also have lots of breads on the salad bar, one of which being cheese bread! Baller. Did I mention the best part?? Salad bar comes free with any entree. Extra legit. The menu itself is even better, they have juicy steaks and chicken dishes as well as lobster for the expensive tastes! I personally love the cheesy potatoes (ok, you get it now I assume, I love cheese). The center cut filet is always juicy and cooked to perfection. If you can imagine this restaurant getting better, it does when you get to the desserts. Great selection and free dessert for every birthday/anniversary with a sparkler!! The waitstaff is ALWAYS very accomodating which really puts the cherry on top of this restaurant for me :)"
"If you are in the mood for some meat, this is the place.  The only reason that you would ever come to this restaurant is for a big hunk of meat, and there is nothing wrong with that.  The portions here are huge, you can get a 32 oz steak if you please!  Other than the meat everything else was just OK.  The service was very good here, and the ambiance was good too (not too Texan for me).  A meal here can get pricey, but I would say it is worth the price."
"one thing you've gotta know about texas:  they love to eat... and they don't quite care about portion control! man, the fact that this place is packed every single day of the week, almost all day and that  they made this place HUGE so it could accomodate, i don't know, a few hundred people, was impressive enough.  then there's about a 1:5 ratio of servers to partrons... it says a lot about how texans know how to chow down!  i must have seen 6 huge groups of people celebrating in the main dining room and then the rest of us... families, couples, singles, just there for the meat, meat, meat!  i mean, they even let you chose your own cut if you want to!   the portions are huge;  the salad bar selection, very impressive;  and  there's gargantuan blocks of cheese that you can shave hunks off of... hunks!!   and the range of prices accomodates everyone... $6-$8 for burgers, salads and sandwiches.  $25-$35 for the steaks.... cooked to order or you're welcome to send it back.  when it comes to steak, there's no room for error, ya hear? yeah, and loved the fact that they have a popcorn machine and drinks for those that wait.  they think of everything when it comes to the art of eating, those texans... i left the place, discretely hiding my unbuttoned jeans with my doggy bag."
"I'm a bit of a traditionalist. For example I believe scotch should only be served neat, on the rocks, and only cut with water. I also believe that steaks should never be served more than medium-rare and only seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. But every now and then I'll come across something that blows my mind and turns my world upside down. So on my first visit, when I decided to try the lemon pepper and garlic butter on my bone-in filet, I was a bit apprehensive. I got the butter garlic on the side, so I didn't use that much of it, but I'm confident in declaring this was pretty much the best steak I've ever had....ever. In fact, everything I eat now pales in comparison. All of a sudden other foods feel uninspired and taste bland. The day seems a little bit grayer and drags on into perpetuity.  I never knew I could feel this way about steak. If I was capable of shedding tears, I would have cried. This is the kind of steak that makes me feel bad for vegetarians, because they'll never know this kind of unbridled bliss. I'm salivating now just thinking about the steak. I can't wait to go back and add color back into my world."
"Simply amazing. This place provides great tasting food and large portions for reasonable prices. It is a little difficult to find and easy to miss the entry driveway but is a definite must if you come to Houston. Their salad bar is so huge that you will probably get stuffed before touching your steak. All meat is fresh not frozen. My favorites are always the prime rib, filet migeon, and their apple butter. All melt in your mouth! They do not take reservations, and we waited over two hours for a large table one Christmas weekend, but it was well worth the wait."
"WORTH EVERY DIME!  They have steaks, cut your own steak from the in house butcher, great sides, great atmosphere and drinks.  This place is worth the extra cost for a great date night or family night."
"my kids love this place, school took them here and thats all they talk about!!!!!"
I am from California and whenever in Houston make it a point to go here. Been going here for almost 20 years. Food/quality / service is so good I would make the move for this Restaurant. -----The best part I am a total vegetarian when in California break all rules when at the Taste of Texas.--- Prefer the older location.
"Other than the wait, primarily on weekends, this is one of the best steaks in town.  Ambience is more casual, good place to take kiddos.  Food ranks up there with Pappas Bros and Del Friscos."
"Hands down the best filet mignon I have ever eaten in my life.  I'm gonna go out on a limb, but even without the steak, the salad bar and bread alone would justify the high prices and long wait time.  If you're in the Houston area and looking for a high class dinner and great dining experience, you've got to try this place."
"Taste of Blandness?  After reading all the hype about Taste of Texas I was looking forward to trying it out.  First of all, the parking lot is a disaster, it is almost always pretty much full (came here two times and the lot was so full, wait so long that we left...finally came early enough on a Sunday to park way at the end of the lot) and there is no valet option. Oh, and they don't take reservations so show up early for dinner. The decor made me feel like I was inside a big log cabin, which was a good feeling.  The salad bar is buffett style and there are plenty of options including fresh fruit and bread, I'd give the salad bar a solid A-.   Now onto the wine menu, they go out of their way to publish their wine prices versus some other expensive steak houses in Houston, amusing, if a bit tacky.  For the main course, I figured a porterhouse steak would be a good way to try two of their steaks since a porterhouse is a strip on one side and filet on the other.  Asked for it medium rare, which they seemed to nail.  The steak had the restaurant's trademark grill marks on it, for whatever reason that gave me a bad impression and reminded me of a Sizzler steak, alas my initial instinct was correct.  The filet side was tender, but lacked flavor and seemed a bit chewy at times.  The strip side was very tough and also had no flavor and at times I thought maybe I was chewing a piece of cardboard. So aside from the flavor, a bad cut as well. Perhaps one of the worst porterhouses I've ever had, although I consider Peter Luger in New York to be the benchmark for porterhouse steak.  There are far better steakhouses in Houston (Del Frisco's, Capital Grille, Pappa's, Vic & Anthony's), if you love salad bars then Taste of Texas is for you, but if you love steak, then try another place."
"Great atmosphere, steaks and wine. 32 ounce steak was insane. Definitely recommended. Much much much better than any chain."
"so back in August when i went for a visit to see my man our last meal befoer i left back to cali was here...""The Taste of Texas""...how fitting...we had a reservation and we asked to have a drink at the bar first so we did and then let the hostess know that we were ready to be seated. she took us to this table that was right next to some type of bachleorette party..uhhh NO....i asked to be resat and she looked at me like i was crazy...so i should technically take off a star for that but the rest of the night made up for her ignorance...(little hostess)...anywho we were reseated and the server came us to us and asked for our drink order...i started with a glass of chardonnay and the bf had a beer lol....the only thing that i didnt care for was the fact that they had a salad bar instead of bring you a salad...for the money that you pay i dont think that i should have to get up and go make my own salad...of course russell loved this part LoL...must go along with the ""everythings bigger in texas""...anywho i ordered the 16oz.new york strip with the herb rub or whatever they recommended and butter and all that jazz...also i got a side of au gratin potatoes...super cheesy and garlic-y...i also had a wonderful glass of pinot noir with my steak...i only ate half it was so big and cooked to a perfect Mid Rare just how i ordered it...the bf took the other half home (to have with an egg for breakfast the next morning!)...i talked russ into having the prime rib since he had never had it before and its one of my favorites...he asked for it to be Medium and thats just how it came...man he like devoured the whole thing...he loved it (woohoo)...we passed on dessert b/c we had ice cream at the house...service was great (minus the hostess)...salad bar (get rid of it, its really tacky in such a nice place)....food (A +++)"
