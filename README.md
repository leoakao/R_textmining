Texting Mining projects in R

# Yelp
Created a workflow to scrape a restaurant's Yelp reviews from yelp.com using Python's BeautifulSoup package and perform text mining 
and sentimental analysis using R's packages. The R code creates word clouds and charts for top positive and negative words used in reviews. 

The 2 subfolders each contain code to analyze reviews from each individual restaurant. Only the name and the URL are changed between the code to analyze Mr. Wok and Taste of Texas' reviews.
