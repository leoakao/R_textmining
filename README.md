Texting Mining projects in R

# Yelp
Created a workflow to scrape restaurant's Yelp reviews from yelp.com using Python's BeautifulSoup package and perform text mining 
and sentimental analysis using R's packages. The R code creates word clouds and charts for top positive and negative words used in reviews.
